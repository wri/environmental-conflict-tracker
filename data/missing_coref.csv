0,5,positive,"There are 56 rivers that flow down from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan to the eastern state of Assam in India to meet the Brahmaputra River. The hills of Bhutan are covered with lush forests, but on the Indian side of the border there are vast tracts of dry plains with occasional patches of severely denuded forests. Not very long ago the forests were contiguous across the borders but internal migration, poverty and increasing demand for fuelwood changed the landscape drastically on the Indian side of the border.

A large share of BhutanÃ¢ÂÂs revenue comes from hydropower projects, although it has been declining over the years, from 44.6% in 2001 to 20% in 2013. Most of these hydropower projects have been developed in cooperation with India. Bhutan currently has an installed hydropower capacity of 1,488 MW, although it hopes to increase this to 20,000 MW.
Due to climate change all the rivers flowing from Bhutan to India have changed their behaviour dramatically in the last decade Ã¢ÂÂ with long periods of dryness, shallow flow and then repeated flash floods, followed by massive amount of silt, sand, sediments, stones and boulders hurtling downstream across the border into India, constantly altering the riverÃ¢ÂÂs course. This has caused hardships and misery to people on both sides of border.
Downstream communities in Assam have regularly raised the alarm, attributing these changes to dam building upstream in Bhutan. They are worried that the plans to build more dams in Bhutan will lead to more flooding, erosion and more destruction than good. The Bhutanese government and their Indian dam consultants have dismissed these objections in the past, but the recent erratic weather patterns have upset all predictions and is now shaping the future flow of the river and BhutanÃ¢ÂÂs relationship with India.

The inhabitants of the India-Bhutan border are among the poorest of the region. The mostly tribal population is recovering from intermittent periods of ethnic conflict and armed clashes in Assam that has displaced over 400,000 people since 1996.
Mass exodus and internal migration have affected employment, land rights and traditional occupations. As a result returning families depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods. Some 70% of the regionÃ¢ÂÂs population is food and energy deficient.
Deadly floods
The flash floods in BhutanÃ¢ÂÂs Sarpang district in 2016 wreaked havoc in downstream areas in AssamÃ¢ÂÂs Kokrajhar and Chirang districts, with the excessive silt turning large tracts of farmland into desert. The silt flow was so huge that the hundreds of farmers in Patgaon, located and close to National Highway 31, still cannot cultivate rice even now.
On July 21, 2017, when the Sarpang River broke its banks again, the town of Sarpang Bazar was entirely washed away by floodwater, cutting the border town of Gelephu off from the road. Fifty-two families were left homeless after continuous heavy rainfall.
Floodwaters and landslides cut off the highway from Phuentsholing on the Bhutan-India border, and landslides brought down power transmission lines, leaving many parts of Bhutan without electricity. The department of roads reported that nine gewogs (districts) were totally cut off.
After the flash floods, Bhutan tried to divert the river away from human settlements to mitigate the damage and also gave permission to stone miners to retrieve and sell stones and boulders from the dried up riverbed, causing much consternation amongst local farmers who were concerned that these activities will increase the current and flow of silt in the river.

Another controversial measure taken by the Bhutan government was to embargo the building of a nine foot tall check dam in the middle of the river, traditionally built and maintained by Indian farmers to divert the water through the Jamfwi aka dongs (irrigation channels) to their villages. Without water from the Jamfwi check dams, the farmers downstream cannot irrigate their crops. This caused much concern and consternation among downstream communities.
Any changes in the river, its flow, its course and its siltation adversely affects farmers. Upstream damming and increased landslides in the mountains have changed once perennial sources of water into dry rivulets in winter. Without irrigation, most farmers are unable to cultivate their land. Women have to go long distances to fetch water for their homes.

The Saralbhanga River (also called Swrmanga) flows from Sarphang district of Bhutan to Assam in India. About 500 farmers from five villages close to the border contribute to building, repairing and maintaining this check dam on the river, a traditional diversion based irrigation system of the Bodo tribe, which is called the Dongo or Jamfwi system.

The Jamfwi or Dongo irrigation system channels water across the border into India through a labyrinth of small canals to irrigate rice and vegetable farms. Communities on both sides of the India-Bhutan border consume the produce.

Anarsingh Iswari, a leader of the Akhand Buryogari Bandh Committee in Navnagar, in Assam grows paddy, black dal and ginger using the traditional irrigation system. When the Bhutan government put an embargo on building of check dams, Anarsingh and Raju Kumar Narzary, executive director of the Northeast Research and Social Work Networking, a Kokrajhar-based NGO and members of All Bodo Students Union, Bodo WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Forum for Peace and Development, met the officials of the Bhutan India Friendship Association to raise the concerns of the farmers.
Traditional irrigation triumphs
The Bhutan India Friendship Association officials facilitated an urgent meeting with the deputy commissioner of Sarphang district of Bhutan and after understanding the plight of the farmers, the Bhutanese officials agreed to allow the farmers to continue to build check dams and also decided to help the farmers divert the water of Saralbhanga River for irrigation purposes, which they have been doing for centuries. This has given huge relief to at least 5,000 farmers.
For 18-year-old Azlka Musahary, a student who helps her family on their farm, this has come as great relief, mainly because she has to walk a shorter distance to collect water for their household needs. Longer conversations with women of the Saralpara village reveal how central the Jamfwi or Dongo irrigation system is to the survival of the villagers.
At the community level, women participate in all decision-making around the amount of water to be lifted for each household and the contribution to the maintenance of the irrigation system. It is the women who have the most at stake and are the ones who want a more permanent solution, a treaty between the two countries if possible, so that there a better conversation about water flow on both sides of the border.
Ã¢ÂÂWater issues in river basins are becoming more and more complex and far reaching at all levels Ã¢ÂÂ local, regional, and national. The story of conflict resolution on Saralbhanga River is a great example of successful people to people engagement supported by administration on both sides,Ã¢ÂÂ Animesh Prakash of Oxfam India told thethirdpole.net. Prakash is in OxfamÃ¢ÂÂs Transboundary Rivers of South Asia project, which aims to contribute to poverty reduction and to reduce marginalisation of vulnerable river basin communities. The project plans to do this through increased community access to and control over riverine water resources.
Ã¢ÂÂWe need to build on the foundation set by the students union and civil society on both sides of the border with continued strategic engagement to promote collective actions to mitigate and adapt to the climate change induced havoc playing out in these parts of western Assam,Ã¢ÂÂ Prakash added. Ã¢ÂÂPeace is essential for implementation of any poverty alleviation and development programme in the region.Ã¢ÂÂ
Clearly, this successful interaction has led to growing interest among local civil society organisations to participate in processes and influence practices at all levels in integrated water resource management and ensure they are more inclusive of community concerns.
Ã¢ÂÂThe golden anniversary of India-Bhutan Friendship offers a perfect opportunity for both the governments to explore how best to cooperate for joint projects to mitigate and adapt to the vagaries of our rivers in interest of citizens of both our countries,Ã¢ÂÂ Ugyen Rabten, Chairperson of Bhutan India Friendship Association, told thethirdpole.net. Ã¢ÂÂHis Majesty the King of Bhutan has repeatedly expressed his interest in building on the past good relations with India to alleviate poverty and sufferings on both sides of the border and what better opportunity than to deal with this clear and present danger posed by the this devastating consequence of climate change.Ã¢ÂÂ

1,7,positive,"The Kerala Assembly last week passed a bill to make it easier to reclaim paddy fields, wetlands and Ã¢ÂÂunnotified landÃ¢ÂÂ for infrastructure development projects. The bill makes 12 amendments and adds two new provisions to the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, which was enacted in 2008 to conserve ecologically sensitive paddy fields and wetlands.

When the amendment bill moved by the Left Democratic Front regime was put to vote on June 25, it was criticised by opposition lawmakers. They said it will further shrink the stateÃ¢ÂÂs paddy fields and cause widespread environmental damage.

Many environmental scientists and activists noted that the bill waters down crucial provisions of the 2008 law, which will likely encourage large-scale land reclamation, causing environmental degradation and groundwater depletion.

Though the bill states that paddy fields and wetlands will be reclaimed only for Ã¢ÂÂprojects that benefit the publicÃ¢ÂÂ, it does not provide a clear definition of such a project.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat are the criteria for identifying projects that benefit the public?Ã¢ÂÂ asked Girigan, principal scientist at the Community Biodiversity Centre run by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation in Wayanad. Ã¢ÂÂIt is a problematic term. The government should allow land reclamation only for projects undertaken by it. In the present context, even real-estate developers can say their housing projects will benefit the public.Ã¢ÂÂ

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, participating in a discussion on the bill in the Assembly, said the changes Ã¢ÂÂallow conversion of paddy and wetlands only for government-approved projectsÃ¢ÂÂ. But his clarification failed to dispel the misgivings as Revenue Minister E Chandrashekharan said the bill will facilitate large infrastructure projects such as a pipeline to be laid by the Gas Authority of India Limited.

The state-run companyÃ¢ÂÂs Kochi-Mangaluru gas pipeline is one of several projects in Kerala that have run into public opposition in the past few years, mostly following disputes over land acquisition. Currently, villagers of Keezhattur in Kannur district are protesting against the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs decision to take over more than 250 acres of paddy fields for laying a bypass road to a national highway.

Weakening oversight

The bill also limits the authority of the monitoring committee in a gram panchayat or a municipality to stop land reclamation for infrastructure projects. The committee is led by the head of the local elected body and has government officials and farmersÃ¢ÂÂ representatives as members. Now, the committee can only report land conversion to district or state monitoring committees. Ã¢ÂÂThe amendment takes away the powers of the local monitoring committee and district committee,Ã¢ÂÂ Girijan said. Ã¢ÂÂIt will lead to rampant land conversion.Ã¢ÂÂ

Critics alleged the introduction of a new land category Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂunnotifed landÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ is another ploy to promote conversion of farmland and wetlands into industrial land. According to the bill, any piece of land listed under the categories of paddy fields or wetlands in the Basic Tax Register but not notified as farmland or wetland in the stateÃ¢ÂÂs data bank for paddy fields and wetlands will be classified as Ã¢ÂÂunnotified landÃ¢ÂÂ. Owners of unnotified land can change its use as long as it does not disrupt Ã¢ÂÂfree of flow of waterÃ¢ÂÂ to neighbouring paddy fields.

S Ushakumari said the Ã¢ÂÂunnotified landÃ¢ÂÂ category was introduced to help real estate developers. Ã¢ÂÂThe state does not have a data bank of paddy fields and wetlands,Ã¢ÂÂ said the director of Thanal, a non-profit that works on environmental issues.

The leader of the opposition, Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress, alleged that real estate developers could reclaim large tracts of Ã¢ÂÂunnotified landÃ¢ÂÂ in the absence of a data bank of wetlands and paddy fields.

In its manifesto for the 2016 Assembly election, the Left Democratic Front had promised to create the data bank within a year of coming to power. It is yet to materialise.

Falling production

Though rice is the KeralitesÃ¢ÂÂ staple food, the state produces only a fraction of the 40 lakh tonnes consumed annually, making it dependent on imports from other states. According to the State Economic Survey for 2016-Ã¢ÂÂ17, Kerala has 7.5% of its cropped area under rice cultivation, yielding 4.37 lakh tonnes.

The area under paddy cultivation decreased from 1.9 lakh hectares in 2015-Ã¢ÂÂ16 to 1.7 lakh hectares in 2016-Ã¢ÂÂ17. This area was 8.75 lakh hectares in 1970-Ã¢ÂÂ71, falling to 8 lakh hectares in 1980-Ã¢ÂÂ81, 5.6 lakh hectares in 1990-Ã¢ÂÂ91 and 3.47 lakh hectares in 2000-Ã¢ÂÂ01.

Girigan said the steep decline was due largely to paddy fields being turned over for realty development. The 2008 law has done little to arrest this trend. Ã¢ÂÂThe degree of conversion has in fact increased after the 2008 law came into being,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂWhat will happen to paddy fields with these amendments? ItÃ¢ÂÂs anybodyÃ¢ÂÂs guess.Ã¢ÂÂ

Senior Congress leader Kodikunnil Suresh claimed the bill Ã¢ÂÂsounds the death knellÃ¢ÂÂ for Kuttanad, known as KeralaÃ¢ÂÂs rice bowl. Ã¢ÂÂIt will increase the reclamation of paddy land,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, adding, Ã¢ÂÂAs a member of Parliament representing Kuttanad region, I will challenge the amendments in the High Court.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ushakumari agreed. Ã¢ÂÂThe 2008 law helped us stop big projects like at Valanthakkad, on a mangrove-rich island in Kochi and Methran Kayal,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂIt wonÃ¢ÂÂt anymore.Ã¢ÂÂ

The bill makes it easier for real estate developers to tempt paddy field owners into parting with their land, she claimed. Ã¢ÂÂWith this bill, the government has also laid the ground for a huge environmental disaster,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.","Paddy fields and wetlands conservation law will decimate them, critics say"

Mumbai: Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the fishermen community in Worli are at loggerheads over the state government's ambitious Coastal Road project. The work to designing has come to a halt with fishermen stalling the seaside survey asking the civic body to increase the gap between two pillars of the coastal road to more than 60 metre.
The Koli people allege that the authorities did not talk to them when the project started in 2016. They also said that NOCs were taken from people who have no connection with fishing.
One fisherman said that the small gap between the pillars would hinder the movement of their boats and disrupt their business. The Bandra-Worli sea link has already affected their business.
Meanwhile, the BMC said that increasing the gap any further would not be feasible and the project cannot be carried out without the survey. Yashwant Jadhav, standing committee chairman, BMC, said, ""The Koli community should not face any difficulty or torture. We held meetings with the leaders of the community in which they asked for a gap of 200 feet, which is 60 metre. However, they now seek a gap of 200 metre which is not possible.""
The Coastal Road project that will connect South Mumbai to suburbs also has a crucial interchange at Bandra-Worli sea link that will connect the coastal road.
The mayor and other officials have tried to convince the Koli community but they are showing stiff opposition saying that their business will be severely affected. They plan to continue opposing the project till the BMC heeds to their commands.

Budget 2018: Even as the date for Union Budget 2018 nears, and the government looks to augment tax revenues by widening the tax base, a pertinent question to be asked is whether FM Arun Jaitley look to bring agriculture income under the tax net? Ã¢ÂÂPrima facie, philosophically it is a great idea, but it is all about the timing. Would the government want to go ahead and impose this levy in a pre-election year? In addition, there are sensitivities of farmers also involved,Ã¢ÂÂ Abhay Laijawala, Head Ã¢ÂÂ India Research, Deutsche Equities said in an interview to CNBC TV18.

The expert pointed out that there has been a lot of distress in the agriculture space, leaving little room for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to bring agriculture income under the tax net in the upcoming Union Budget 2018. Ã¢ÂÂClearly over the last three years we have seen acute rural distress and if the government goes ahead and instead of resolving this distress is seen imposing a tax on agriculture, politically there would be a very low political threshold for the same,Ã¢ÂÂ Abhay Laijawala told the channel.

He was demanding a remunerative price and regular payment for his produce. That was an ominous portent.

In its election manifesto, Congress had promised to make agriculture the backbone of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs economy. It proposed a comprehensive plan including timely supply of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and other inputs; remunerative and competitive prices for sugarcane, coffee, cotton and sericulture; provision of storage facilities, electricity, irrigation, subsidies for buying modern equipment and, lastly, compensation during drought situations.

Despite all these promises, as many as 3,515 farmers in Karnataka committed suicide between April 2013 and November 2017. Seventy percent of them were on account of drought and farm failure, according to State Agriculture Department. By comparison, 1,077 farmers took their lives in the previous five-year period.

Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we have done loan waiver and many other relief measures.Ã¢ÂÂ While the government increased suicide compensation from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, farmers say what they want is better irrigation and a fair price for their produce.

Mandya, a district in the Cauvery basin, has witnessed highest rate of farmer suicides in the past 3 years owing to crop loss and indebtedness. Puttaswamy, a sericulturist from Dhangur village in Mandya district, had taken a loan by mortgaging his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs jewelry. He couldnÃ¢ÂÂt repay the loan, so he drank poison, says his brother Doddaswamy.

Devanand Gaikwad, a farmer-union leader from Bidar, complains that sugarcane farming is becoming non-viable as growers often donÃ¢ÂÂt get paid. Poor prices for farm produce has also been a major cause of indebtedness.

'Want water, not compensation'

In March this year, Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission (KAPC) chairman TN Prakash Kammardi recommended making the minimum support price (MSP) of crops fixed by the government legally binding. Even though the state government has fixed MSP for most crops, they are traded at significantly lower prices in markets, including those run by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Cooperatives across Karnataka, he said.

The KAPC is inefficient, says Shankar Ambali, state general secretary of Raita Sene, a farmerÃ¢ÂÂs association. Ã¢ÂÂOnion growing farmers are struggling to sell their goods,Ã¢ÂÂ he says. Ã¢ÂÂDuring the last five years, many crops like maize, tur dal, tomatoes and onions have seen steep falls in their prices, impacting farmersÃ¢ÂÂ income.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThe government neither fixed a proper market price for the produce nor gave us any compensation; it has thus failed to stop farmer suicides,Ã¢ÂÂ says Appasaheb Desai, a farmer from Belagavi district in North Karnataka, which recorded one of the highest suicide rates.

AL Sivakumar, a farmer from Ankanahalli, says he does not want compensation but water for cultivating ragi and rice. ""Five years ago, we used to get water from Iglur dam. People used to grow ragi and rice. But after the canal broke, there is no water in this area and itÃ¢ÂÂs become dry land,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.

Looming threat of drought

About 72 percent of the cropped area in Karnataka depends on the monsoons, leaving most parts of state exposed to the threat of drought. Despite governmentÃ¢ÂÂs promises to expand irrigation networks, the irrigated area in the state is actually declining. According to the Karnataka Economic Survey report published this February, while 34.40 lakh hectares were under irrigation in 2011-12, the figure dropped to 32.20 lakh hectares in 2015-16.

Says AV Manjunatha, assistant professor at ISEC, Ã¢ÂÂThe farmers, especially in Chikkaballapur, have to dig bore wells up to 1,300 feet to get water, which vastly increases the cost of fetching water.Ã¢ÂÂ

In its 2013 Economic Survey, the Congress government listed the problems afflicting agriculture in Karnataka. They included over dependency on the monsoon, fragmentation of land, deteriorating soil health, lack of market information and low penetration of technology. Four years later, in its February survey, the government has just added to the list: Low level of public investment, inefficient use of water resources, environmental degradation and rising cost of production.

Agriculture minister Byre Gowda admits there is much more to be done but defends his government saying, Ã¢ÂÂWe have given a stable and scandal-free government for five years. KarnatakaÃ¢ÂÂs growth rate is 8.5 percent compared to the national average of 6.6 percent.Ã¢ÂÂ But that is little consolation to the stateÃ¢ÂÂs farmers, who have been waiting for a long time to share in that growth.

As Mallikarjun Satyampet, state secretary of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha in Yadgir, says, Ã¢ÂÂThere has been no improvement in the economic condition of farmers in the past 10 years. We hope the new government will do something for us.Ã¢ÂÂ

11,82,positive,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in India are investigating whether a deadly protest over the alleged slaughter of a cow, an animal many Hindus consider sacred, was aimed at sparking religious tension during a Muslim gathering.
MondayÃ¢ÂÂs violence in the countryÃ¢ÂÂs most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which killed two people, brings back to the national spotlight a trend of cow vigilantism by hardline Hindu groups ahead of a general election due in less than six months.
Police have arrested four of 27 men named in a complaint after a police officer and a man were killed in the northern stateÃ¢ÂÂs district of Bulandshahr as tens of thousands of Muslims gathered for a religious event.
Police would try to determine the age of the cow carcass, police official Anand Kumar said when asked if there had been a conspiracy to vitiate the atmosphere by using a dead cow brought in from elsewhere.
Ã¢ÂÂIf there was anything like that, then the details will come out,Ã¢ÂÂ Kumar, the stateÃ¢ÂÂs second highest police official, told a news conference. Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs an intelligence investigation and all these aspects will be looked into.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Muslim religious event ended peacefully and the situation had returned to normal, Kumar added.
Police have yet to arrest the main suspect, who belongs to the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal, said Bholendra, a leader of the group, who goes by one name.
Only an investigation would reveal if members of the group were guilty, he added. Ã¢ÂÂEvery action has a reaction,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, however, while adding that the group did not believe in unprovoked violence.
Last year, a Reuters investigatihere showed that cow vigilantism flourished during the first three years of the term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, run by his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Bhola Singh, the BJP lawmaker from the district, told reporters the protests escalated because people were agitated over two recent incidents of cow slaughter.
The dead police officer, Subodh Kumar Singh, had helped lead an investigation into the 2015 murder by a Hindu mob of a Muslim man rumored to have slaughtered a cow in a village that is about an hourÃ¢ÂÂs travel away by road from the district.
The family of the man, a blacksmith, denied the accusation that they secretly ate beef, which is banned in many Indian states including Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by a Hindu priest from the BJP.
Police officer Kumar declined to say why Singh was transferred from the area and the murder case handed to another officer.",Indian police probe if violence over dead cow was result of conspiracy
12,86,positive,"Sources said data on farmer suicides is sent by state governments to the crime records bureau
The government has no data on farmer suicides in the last three years, the agriculture minister has said in parliament at a time a farm crisis over debts and poor crop prices has hit several states.
Union Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh told parliament on Tuesday that the National Crime Records Bureau, which collects such data, has not published figures of farmer suicides since 2016.
The minister was responding to a question by Trinamool Congress leader Dinesh Trivedi, who had asked details about the number of farmers who had committed suicide since 2016 and whether the government planned to rehabilitate their families.
""The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs compiles and disseminates information on suicides... These reports on suicides are available up to 2015 on its website. The reports for the year 2016 onwards have not been published yet,"" the minister said in a written reply that detailed other steps taken by the government in a country where 70 per cent of the population relies on agriculture.
A farmer carries a bundle of sugarcane in Uttar Pradesh (Reuters)
Top agriculture ministry sources said data on farmer suicides is sent by state governments to the crime records bureau, which then collates the inputs and publishes it.
""Such data is published only till 2015, so the agriculture ministry can only go by this data,"" said sources, adding that the national crime records bureau functions under the home ministry.
Data for each year is published the following year in a report titled ""Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India"".
In 2015, the report reveals, over 8,000 farmers committed suicide. Maharashtra had the highest number (3030), followed by Telangana (1358) and Karnataka (1197). Over 4500 agricultural labourers committed suicide. That year, the report began publishing reasons for farm suicides. Most suicides were because of debts and bankruptcy.

Since then, there have been several agitations by farmers - last year, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest in Madhya Pradesh's Mandsaur - but no official data on suicides. This was flagged recently by journalist P Sainath, who participated in a farmers' march and protest in Delhi last month.
In 2014, the crime records bureau reported 5,650 farmer suicides. That year, the bureau started separating data for farmers and agricultural labourers, which raised questions.
Reports quote the National Crime Records Bureau as saying that the data is under scrutiny and the report for 2016 is likely to be published later.

13,90,positive,"Professor MS Swaminathan, known as the 'Father of the Green Revolution', spoke in support of the Kisan Mukti March (farmers' freedom march) in Delhi on Friday. Swaminathan, an agriculture scientist who was in charge of a commission to study and suggest solutions for the growing farmer distress, said that ""farmers have come to the conclusion that only agitation and not reasoning will lead to action on their problems"".
The ultimate result of the research, which was conducted between 2004 and 2006, was called the 'National Policy for Farmers' (NCF) or the Swaminathan Commission report.
At least 50,000 farmers from all over the country have gathered in Delhi to protest against the dormant approach of the central and state governments towards the chronic problems faced by the community. Over Thursday and Friday, farmers under the umbrella organisation of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) have made their displeasure with the Centre's agrarian policies evident in various ways.
One of the community's major demands, which was even put forward by the Kisan Long March which took place in Maharashtra in March 2018, is the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report. As a means to this end, the farmers are demanding a 21-day special session of the Parliament. The farmers are also demanding the waiving of loans and an effective rate of minimum support price (MSP) on their crops.
Asserting that evidence of the agrarian crisis has been growing over the last decade, Swaminathan said in a statement, ""The demand for loan waiver comes from the present non-remunerative nature of farming and is indicative of the fact economic viability is as important to farmers as to industrialists."" He also said that an adequate MSP ""will make farming economically viable and attractive"" for the farmers.
The waiver of loans assumes significance for the farmers, according to Swaminathan, so that they can rid themselves of debt and get back to farming, however, only ""by taking another loan"". Swaminathan expressed unhappiness over the fact that ""electoral politics"" bring ""solutions like loan waivers"" into focus for a limited amount of time. He elaborated, ""Only integrated attention paid to pricing, procurement and public distribution will address farmers' woes.""
At least 60 percent of India's population uses agriculture for livelihood and this percentage is mostly made up of women and the youth, according to Swaminathan. This vast majority, largely ignored, has realised the discrepancy in the level of attention the government pays to its issues, and to problems of other sections of society. Swaminathan said, ""Farmers have now understood that while the problems of the other sections of society receive continuous attention, their own problems tend to be neglected unless they agitate.""
According to Swaminathan's statement, the government must bring out changes to its policies based on the ""serious"" repercussions of climate change as well. He said, ""Compounding the difficulties of today, the most unfavourable impact of climate change will be high temperature, wide variation in precipitation and rise in sea level.""
He added that ""equal attention"" should be paid to families living and working in different ecosystems like: Arid zones, semi-arid dry farming areas, irrigated areas, groundwater farming, and plantation crops in hilly areas. Swaminathan added, ""The support extended to farmers should be according to the requirements of those cultivating in the above-mentioned ecosystems.""
The Congress government led by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, however, ""did not take action"" on the NCF presented in 2007, Swaminathan said in the statement. He added that the reports under the NCF gave ""a clear sense of direction"" to shape the agriculture sector ""based on farmers' welfare"".
Referring to the AIKSCC protest, Swaminathan said, ""The march has rightly called for a special Parliament session to discuss issues confronting those who provide us with sustenance. It is sad that farmers who are life givers are forced to take their own life due to economic reasons. I sincerely hope that todayÃ¢ÂÂs Kisan Mukti March will be a turning point in the history of public policy formulation in the field of agriculture.""
In the statement, Swaminathan expressed hope that one of the suggestions of the NCF that the government did implement, which was to change the name of the agriculture ministry to 'Ministry of Agriculture and FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Welfare', would get ""reflected in action"". He said, ""The change in name should get reflected in action designed to promote farmersÃ¢ÂÂ well-being as the main purpose of agriculture ministries at the Centre and states.""
A few of the suggestions made by the NCF were: To prevent the diversion of forest and agricultural land to the corporate sector for non-agricultural purposes; to set up a system to regulate the sale of agricultural land; to give farmers an MSP of 50 percent above the cost of production.

It is a time when the farmers pay obeisance to nature, and celebrate a bountiful harvest. TAFE Ã¢ÂÂ Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited took the opportunity to honour these farmers through its Ã¢ÂÂBe a #FarmDostÃ¢ÂÂ initiative Ã¢ÂÂ a social awareness campaign aimed at bringing the farmer back into our social consciousness. The initiative through its Ã¢ÂÂDay at the FarmÃ¢ÂÂ event sought to bridge the gap between urban residents and the farming community by getting them to interact with farmers, live their life for a day and experience the farm life. The event gave the city bred an opportunity to realise the efforts of farmers towards nourishing and sustaining us and helped foster an environment of respect and appreciation for them.The day long event began with around 100 participants from Bengaluru along with 30 local farmers, who together, indulged in farm activities like sapling planting, farm tending and harvesting, followed by a much sought after tractor ride and practical sessions on irrigation and organic fertilizer making. The farmers enthusiastically participated in an interactive session with Dr. T N Shivananda - Principal Scientist (Soil Science) form the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, who exchanged valuable and relevant information on scientific farming practices to increase yield, productivity and profitability.Post lunch, that comprised of authentic rural cuisine and local specialty food, Dr. T N Shivananda briefed the participants on the highlight of the day Ã¢ÂÂ the Ã¢ÂÂBuild-a-FarmÃ¢ÂÂ challenge. In this challenge, farmers and participants were clubbed into various teams and asked to plan and build a model farm. Here, the farmers acted as mentors and lead their teams. The groups were given 45 minutes to complete the activity, post which they were assessed by Dr. Shivananda. This activity got the teams totally engrossed in strategic discussions with the farmers about the choice of crops to plant, combination of millets, grains, vegetable, fruits and intercropping plans. The groups planned every detail of their farm from scratch. From entry and approach to the farm, farm boundaries, water sources, solar panels to generate electricity, irrigation, to even calculating the input cost and arriving at the annual earnings based on realistic farm scenarios, the teams gave it their all. The winning teams were awarded, and the farmers were felicitated for joining the TAFE Be a #FarmDost Ã¢ÂÂDay on the FarmÃ¢ÂÂ event.The evening saw all participants unwind over tea as they indulged in a rustic music performance by the Vasu Dixit Collective. The collective performed Kannada songs with a rural appeal that had both the farmers and the city bred singing along in sweet harmony.The event concluded with an interactive session, where participants expressed their hearty gratitude to farmers, emphasised how this event exceeded their expectations and impacted them forever. The event saw an eclectic mix of students, IT professionals, and corporates working in textile, banking, HR, construction and manufacturing. Children as young as 3 years and sprightly senior citizens participated in all activities with equal enthusiasm. Over 60% of the participants were youngsters and that paved the way for future generation to learn the importance of farmers and being connected to the soil. The families that came together to celebrate farmers and farming, went home with a new found respect for farmers and the farming profession, with beautiful memories and new friendships forged for life. This event by TAFE was an eye-opener for the city dwellers, who could now empathize with the hardworking farming community. TAFE has a legacy of about 6 decades in India and is the worldÃ¢ÂÂs third largest tractor manufacturer. They launched the Ã¢ÂÂBe a #FarmDostÃ¢ÂÂ initiative with the aim to raise empathy for farmers by encouraging people to step into their shoes, even if for a little while.

The deceased are identified as Tatyabhau Khairnar (44) and Manoj Dhondage (33) who hailed from Baglan taluka in the north Maharashtra district.
Farmers in Nashik district, which accounts for 50 per cent of onion production in India, have claimed that they are unable to fetch good returns for their produce due to glut in production.
A Baglan taluka police official Sunday said Khairnar allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his onion shed in Bhadane village Friday.

Mumbai: In an attempt to curb encroachments in forest areas of Thane, the forest department has proposed the construction of an eight feet high compound wall along a 4.5 km stretch of forestland. Initially the compound wall had been proposed at the forest stretch of Kalwa and Mumbra that are the most vulnerable areas. The Asian Age had yesterday reported that encroachment cases were found to be higher in Thane forest in the period of 2016-17.

According to the forest department, total encroachment in the forest area of Thane is 16,159 hutments on a land area of 63.06 hectares (ha). Out of which, 1,201 hutments were removed from forest area during various encroachment removal drives in 2017 reclaiming 2.165 hectares of area. Total forest area in Mumbra and Kalwa is 260.297 ha.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have escalated the proposal of construction wall to higher authorities. The wall will help protect the forestland from huge pressure of encroachment from slums that have come up adjoining forest areas.

Ã¢ÂÂMany hutments claim that they have been established before the year 2000. So, they move the court stating that their hutments are legal as per the state slum regularisation policy.

Over the next few years, the company cut down more than half the forest. While conducting evictions, staff and security forces looted rice fields and demolished or burned more than 300 homes. Many people lost their land and all their belongings. Parents sent their children to work in Thailand, unable to farm and afford school fees.

Villagers are trying to recover some of their losses through a class action lawsuit. But even if they are successful, it will provide little remedy for the felled forests, destroyed homes and disruption of community life.

This story is all too common to the 2.5 billion people living on indigenous and community lands. These lands, crucial for livelihoods, are protected under international human rights law and social and environmental standards: Indigenous Peoples may not be relocated from their land without their free, prior and informed consent, and customary and informal land rights should be respected. Many national laws also incorporate these principles. However, because many communities lack legal titles to their land, governments may consider it empty and allocate it to companies. Corporations and others may consider the land to be idle or underdeveloped.

In reality, community land represents the backbone of rural life. Its lossÃ¢ÂÂwhether due to conflict, infrastructure projects, private investments or natural disastersÃ¢ÂÂhas grave consequences, including:

Loss of Livelihoods

Communities rely on collective lands for agriculture, livestock grazing and water. Community lands provide key foods, such as fish, game, honey and edible plants, as well as medicinal herbs, fuel and building materials. When displaced communities lose access to these resources, they may have insufficient space for traditional agricultural or grazing practices, such as letting land lie fallow. The result is decreased food security and increased stress on water resources.

Companies or governments may promise jobs and social services to displaced communities, but they seldom materialize. Jobs may be plentiful during the early stages of a project (for clearing land or building infrastructure), but they rarely translate into long-term employment. Small-scale farmers who lose land to larger projects experience an estimated 28 to 75 percent net loss in jobs.

Resettlement projects often cannot replace the loss of these resources. The experience of a Mozambican community, resettled from a protected area, is typical. The new location did not have sufficient space for agriculture and cattle, and community members did not receive promised jobs. Instead, they had to pay for water and food, which they had previously gathered for free from their land. Similarly, residents displaced by commercial farming in Zambia reported that their new land was infertile, they lost access to fish and game, and government-provided food aid was insufficient.

Increased Risk of Conflict

Community displacement places new pressures on surrounding land and resources, increasing competition and heightening the risk of conflict. This can create immediate tensions between communities, or re-emerge as an escalating factor in broader violent conflicts, such as in KenyaÃ¢ÂÂs 2008 election-related violence, where grievances over displacement and land corruption fueled violence between political parties.

Similarly, two-thirds of all disputes between investors and communities in Africa occur where communities are displaced from their land. A study of 174 Indonesian palm oil companies found that land disputes were the primary driver of social conflict. In some cases, such conflicts are accompanied by violent encounters with security guards, threats and assassinations of community activists, or violent altercations when police or military enforce evictions.

Loss of Identity and Culture

For many communities, especially Indigenous Peoples, land is a locus of identity and culture as much as an economic resource. Displacement disrupts community structures and traditions, and means the loss of sacred and cultural sites. These intangibles can be irreplaceable: One mining company in Peru agreed to an unusually generous resettlement town for an Indigenous community, including paved streets, indoor plumbing and electricity. But three years later, residents complained of a lack of meaningful work and a loss of traditions. Rates of alcoholism rose, and in one year, four residents killed themselves by taking farming chemicals. According to one former farmer, the residents felt they were trapped Ã¢ÂÂin a cage where little animals are kept.Ã¢ÂÂ

Similarly, in Canada and Brazil, some anthropologists link alarmingly high suicide rates in certain Indigenous communities to a loss of traditional lands. In Australia, Indigenous Peoples who live on their own land have a life expectancy 10 years longer than resettled communities. And after the Ecuadorean military evicted an indigenous village to make way for a mine, psychiatrists documented mental health problems in 42 percent of villagers, especially children traumatized by the noise of military helicopters.

Broader Environmental and Social Harms

Displacements from community lands can also exacerbate existing inequalities. Groups who are already marginalized are more likely to be displaced, and less able to advocate for their rights. For example, in India, Indigenous Peoples make up 8 percent of the population but constitute 40 percent of those displaced by development projects. Displacement has disproportionate impacts on women, whose use of collective lands are inadequately considered during resettlement.

Furthermore, large-scale land acquisitions that displace communities are primarily agricultural and mining projects, which require large amounts of water or cause deforestation. In contrast, Indigenous Peoples and rural communities are typically good environmental stewards. For example, in response to logging that was destroying their community forests, the indigenous Huay Hin Lad Nai village in Thailand set up a sustainable land and forest use system, including rules for restoring the forest and fostering traditional practices.

It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to be this way. Projects that work with communities, instead of displacing them, can better accommodate a variety of land uses and avoid over-taxing natural resources. Communities also know how important their land is, and many are finding creative ways to protect it.

22,133,positive,"Expert in International Water Resource Management, Specialist in Water Security and Climate Variability in Sri Lanka, and Until recently, WASH Advisor for ZOA, Sudan Dr. Timotheus Gaasbeek, Research Group Leader for Water Risks and Disasters International Water Management Institute Dr. Giriraj Armarnath, Deputy Director south Asia Center London School of Economist Dr. Nilanjan Sarkar, Senior Researcher (Environment and Development Economics) International Water Management Institute Dr. Soumya Balasubramanya and Deputy Director of Research Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka Dr. P. B. Dharmasena
Natural resources, such as water, are under extreme pressure in contemporary times. As the effects of global warming and climate variability become more evident, water takes centre stage as an unfolding global crisis. Increasingly, we hear of cities with depleting water supplies, agricultural lands rendered arid by a lack of rainfall, and communities suffering from diseases caused by poor water quality.
Problems are especially acute in South Asia, where this is complicated further by the challenges posed by a lack of options for sustainably managing water, in terms of equitable access or available technology. Dense and increasing (ageing) populations, expanding agricultural sectors, and the pollution of waterways are other issues that South Asia grapples with.
A deep look at the issues around ensuring water security and managing water resources is therefore of critical concern. Governments must consider the critical nature of water when devising development plans and economic and social policies and programs.
For an island nation like Sri Lanka, the prospect of depleting water resources and fresh water availability is especially serious. Already, the country faces numerous challenges related to managing water, such as persistent droughts and changes in rainfall affecting agriculture, coral and sand mining, marine pollution, energy and irrigation demand, groundwater pollution, wastewater management, etc. Water in Sri Lanka is associated with complex management challenges, with nearly 40 statutory bodies responsible for water resources.
The lack of a comprehensive strategy and a coordinated approach could have a severe impact on Sri Lanka and its people, as population and development pressures threaten limited fresh water resources.
Recently the latest instalment of Ã¢ÂÂColombo Development Dialogues,Ã¢ÂÂ a collaborative initiative by the LSE South Asia Centre (LSE-SAC) and the United Nations Development Programme in Sri Lanka - in partnership with Dilmah Tea, Citra Social Innovation Lab, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies - looked at the question of water security in Sri Lanka through its specific problems.
The aim of the discussion, the theme of which was Ã¢ÂÂWater Security and Climate Variability,Ã¢ÂÂ was to underline the need to continuously search for newer ways to understand the critical nature of the issue that confronts us all.
Poor water management
One of the primary problems flagged by a panel of experts in attendance was Sri LankaÃ¢ÂÂs inefficient utilisation of rainwater. Dr P.B. Dharmasena, Deputy Director of Research Department of Agriculture, points out that in the case of Sri Lanka water resources are abundant Ã¢ÂÂ something that may come as a surprise considering the drought affecting several parts of the country Ã¢ÂÂ but that the islandÃ¢ÂÂs present water management systems retain less than half of the rainfall the country receives annually. A majority of it, he explains, is lost to the ocean.
Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre really blessed with rainfall Ã¢ÂÂ our annual average rainfall is about 2000mms Ã¢ÂÂ and if you just calculate the land area you will get about 130 billion cubic meters. But unfortunately more than 50% of that will go to the sea,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.
Ã¢ÂÂThe question is why canÃ¢ÂÂt we get more and more water within the land without releasing it to the sea? We experience floods intermittently, we experience droughts intermittently, but we have enough water. If we just look at our island, we have 103 river basins of which about 16 river basins are very important and significant as far as the area is concerned, and also the total volume of water is concerned. If we just take them separately, some river are releasing more than 60-70% of its water.Ã¢ÂÂ
Of the 103 river basins, 80 major reservoirs and dams, and over 25000 combined minor tanks and anicuts in Sri Lanka, there are large disparities when it comes to effective water retention in some of the biggest rivers in the country.
Take for example the Gin Ganga, Kalu Ganga, and Kelani Ganga, all three of which leak 60-70% of the annual rainfall it receives, while none of the Kala Oya, Malwathu Oya, or Yan Oya leak more than 20%. In fact if you compare the Kalu Ganga which receives over 10,000 cubic metres of rainfall annually with the Walawe Ganga which receives a similar amount, the difference is stark: the former leaks 77% to the ocean on average annually, while the latter just 22%.
This, says Dharmasena, is down to the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs ignorance when it comes to the countryÃ¢ÂÂs ancient water management systems. Namely, Sri Lanka needs to make better use of its tank cascade ecosystems.
Ã¢ÂÂWe can minimise flood and drought if you manage it as far the river basins are concerned. In these river basins if you can have reservoirs in proper locations, not in the upper part of the river basin but in the middle of it that will solve the problem of drought and flood.
Ã¢ÂÂSecond, we have a very long history of water management, and itÃ¢ÂÂs not only on the basis of the river basin. Water is diverted from one river basin to the other in order to compensate the deficit of water in one river basin. For example, there are giant canals to divert water from Kala Oya to Malwathu Oya and from Malwathu Oya to Kanagarawa where you get a lot of deficits of water.
Ã¢ÂÂWe should not forget that in a lot of areas we have clusters of tanks, tank cascades systems Ã¢ÂÂ we have identified about 1,600 tank cascades in the North and North Central, North Western, and Southern Provinces. These tank cascade systems are not only for irrigation, itÃ¢ÂÂs an ecosystem. And these ecosystems should be restored to ensure that the water is available for both the population and the environment.Ã¢ÂÂ
To do this however requires effective coordination between water-related agencies in the country, something that is much easier said than done when you consider that there are over 10 ministries overlooking water management in the country, all of which are linked to 28 separate State agencies.
Dharmasena suggests the implementation of an apex body, but one with open channels to engage with all relevant stakeholders. Certain issues, he noted, would only be known to those operating at ground level and that those problems should be addressed at a divisional secretariat level, while the macro issues must be addressed by a national body.
Ã¢ÂÂWe should have a coordination body, which is independent of politics, compromising national level, district level and divisional secretariat level committees. The decision making should be allowed both ways - from bottom to top and top to bottom,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Addressing variability in rainfall and climate
Another key point brought up was the need to acknowledge climate and rainfall variability over prolonged periods. Dr. Timotheus Gaasbeek, an expert in International Water Resource Management, and a specialist in Water Security and Climate Variability in Sri Lanka, noted that since the advent of long-term climate data recordings it has been made clear that Sri Lanka is prone to sustained wet and dry periods.
The issue however, he explains, is that when it comes to that some of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs water management systems werenÃ¢ÂÂt built taking into consideration these long-term trends.
Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at low rainfall time series for Sri Lanka there are dry and wet periods. Around 1900-1920 it was dry, then it got wet, in the late 1940s it was dry again, it got wet again, and from about 1970-2000 it was dry, and it got wetter again.
Ã¢ÂÂAnd thatÃ¢ÂÂs important because our water demand keeps growing. And after a period where structurally the availability of water has reduced because there is less rain, we have designed things with a much high rainfall in mind Ã¢ÂÂ this is where we create a problem for ourselves. The other way around, if we create things with only low rainfall in mind and we get a wet period, we get extra flooding and our systems canÃ¢ÂÂt cope with it.Ã¢ÂÂ
According to Gaasbeek, as per this cycle Sri Lanka is now in the midst of wet period, which may come as shock to many considering several parts of the country are undergoing severe drought. This long-term cycle, he believes, is down to a phenomenon taking place as far off as the North Atlantic, which he believes is going to leave Sri Lanka experience a dry period in the near future.
Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs only one cycle I know that has pretty much the same pattern and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the ocean between Greenland and Iceland. When that grows cold, the winds over the Atlantic change and the rain doesnÃ¢ÂÂt go over England, it goes over Scandinavia. The wind then cools down and curls around high pressure areas into Africa, and further into China, and into India. If another period is coming where the North Atlantic cools and this cycle goes into a cold phase, that means Sri Lanka is going to have to deal with less and less rain.Ã¢ÂÂ
Parallel to a point made by Dharmasena, Gaasbeek believes that in terms of water management infrastructure in the country, what is already in place might not necessarily have the upcoming change in cycle. This he notes as already had dire consequences for the country in terms of water management over recent decades.
Ã¢ÂÂA lot of our recent irrigation schemes were built in the Ã¢ÂÂ70s, with rainfall data from the 1930s onwards, which was a wet period. Straight after the systems were built the rainfall reduced and suddenly things didnÃ¢ÂÂt work as they were supposed to because we didnÃ¢ÂÂt have the rain that we were supposed to have.
Ã¢ÂÂIt partially recovered but it might happen again. It will influence food production in Sri Lanka and that means, structurally for a period of time Sri Lanka will need to find a way to manage its agricultural economy, its water economy.Ã¢ÂÂ
Possible structural connotations
One other point Gaasbeek brought up surrounded changing rainfall patterns in Sri LankaÃ¢ÂÂs hill country, which he points out has been declining consistently, and has in turn resulted in increasing trouble for tea estates. In this same period, Colombo has gotten much wetter.
Gaasbeek posits this could be down to man-made changes, such as shifts in land use and increased deforestation.
Ã¢ÂÂFor some reason during the South West monsoon the water that used to fall in Nuwara Eliya is falling here [in Colombo]. The clouds form earlier, the rain falls earlier, and by the time it reaches Nuwara Eliya thereÃ¢ÂÂs not so much rain anymore.
Ã¢ÂÂI have a hunch, but itÃ¢ÂÂs only a hunch, that it might have to do with changes in land use. Over the last 150 years the hill country has changed dramatically, from a lot of forest to a combination of plantations, towns, villages, and fields. And they react completely differently in terms of evaporation, and in terms of cooling the air.Ã¢ÂÂ
While he is unable to say with certainty that this is in fact the cause for changes in rainfall seen in the hill country, Gaasbeek urges the relevant stakeholders to take time and investigate any possible correlation between rainfall and changes in land use.
Ã¢ÂÂBecause if there is a correlation,Ã¢ÂÂ says Gaasbeek. Ã¢ÂÂThen it also means there is something we can do to address it and bring the rain back to tea.Ã¢ÂÂ
Gender inclusiveness
An oft-overlooked aspect of water resource management, is how water security means different things to men and women. Addressing this issue was the key tenet of Dr. Soumya BalasubramanyaÃ¢ÂÂs presentation.
As a Senior Researcher (Environment and Development Economics) at the International Water Management Institute, Balasubramanya has used economic methods to address environmental and development challenges in Asia and Africa, and through has identified several issues in relation to gender inclusivity in solving this problem of effective water management.
Gender inclusiveness, she explains, is essential for water security, and gathering data and facts is a vital aspect of designing policies and programs that improve equity along gender lines. The first step in achieving this is through the collection of Ã¢ÂÂbetter dataÃ¢ÂÂ so as to tackle myths and support evidence-based policymaking.
Ã¢ÂÂHow many men and women spend their time in different economic sectors is likely to change as the pressures change themselves,Ã¢ÂÂ she notes. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs particularly important to collect time-series data because the roles of men and women can, and often do, change over time.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Department of Census and Statistics of the Sri Lanka does a very good job actually of collecting gender delineated data for various economic sectors.Ã¢ÂÂ
Looking through the data from the census department, Balasubramanya found that Ã¢ÂÂabout 33% of women are employed in agriculture and about 40-50% of the agricultural workforce is itself femaleÃ¢ÂÂ. A staggering statistic that puts forth irrefutable proof that the average Sri Lankan farmer is female, despite many peopleÃ¢ÂÂs inclination to picture men when it comes to agriculture and irrigation.
Ã¢ÂÂA study in 2016 by the Sri Lanka Water Publisher demonstrated that the involvement of women in agriculture is severely underreported. Contrary to popular belief women were undertaking what you might call technical tasks, such as irrigation, watering paddy fields, and working on crops as well.Ã¢ÂÂ
Furthermore, Balasubramanya points out how patters of migration in Sri Lanka have changed in recent times, with males more likely to migrate now rather than female. This, she explains, has significant implications in the designing of programs in the agricultural sector and in community based water management programs.
Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to invest directly to increase the capacities and capabilities of women. Because traditional agricultural extension programs relied on training men, who in turn trained women.
Ã¢ÂÂBut that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily always work because we know information does not diffuse neutrally along gender lines. Men are more likely to talk to men, women are more likely to talk to women.
Ã¢ÂÂIt also means changing how you design training programs, you may have to train in villages rather than getting the trainees to come, you may have to design child care facilities.
Ã¢ÂÂIf men are not going to be around it really calls for a change in who we train and how we train them.Ã¢ÂÂ
Resilient solutions
Up until now, each of the speakers had spoken of the problems at hand and the need for solutions. None however had put forward ideas on how exactly Sri Lanka could go about implementing or achieving those solutions. Dr. Giriraj Armarnath, Research Group Leader for Water Risks and Disasters International Water Management Institute, believes he has some of the answers.
Drawing on his work in other parts of South Asia, Armarnath is major proponent of utilising technology and data-driven systems when formulating effective and resilient solutions. According to his bio his expertise lies in Ã¢ÂÂthe monitoring of floods and droughts, rapid emergency response mapping, remote sensing data and image processing, geographical information systems, satellite-based rainfall estimates, drought forecasting, hydrological modelling, flood forecasting and inundation modelling, weather-index insurance, food security, agricultural water management, climate change, and disaster risk managementÃ¢ÂÂ.
And his work has seen real-world results in places like India, Bangladesh and Thailand, where flooding is a recurring problem.
Ã¢ÂÂWe built sub-surface solutions in India, Bangladesh and Thailand. What this means is that when there are excess flood waters coming, we divert that water along several ponds in the irrigation system or rain-flood system, and this water can then be used in the dry season when there is a situation like a drought happening,Ã¢ÂÂ he explains.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Government of India is already investing a huge developmental scale of this project in Uttar Pradesh, in places where we have potential to catch flood water over 22%. 22% is quite a lot when we talk about managing the water.Ã¢ÂÂ
A similar project is in fact being initiated by the Asian Development Bank, which is working with Sri Lanka to deliver surplus water from the Mahaweli river basin to the dry zone region Ã¢ÂÂ an area in which 70% of rural dwellers depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. The program is building or upgrading more than 260 km of canals, reservoirs and other irrigation infrastructure to deliver water to areas suffering from regular water scarcity and drought.
For Armarnath, this is a step in the right direction, but he strongly stresses that more needs to be done, and that integrated urban water management are the need of the hour.
Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not about working with one or two agencies; we need to put together academic institutes, where we can talk about system developments, policy analysis, so as to ensure that there is clear development that takes place.
Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre talking about human wellbeing on the water quality, weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about ecosystems, we also need to talk about the economic development. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what water security is all about. Around that you talk about financing, government, political agenda. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not about just setting up some flood models or diverting some of the water.
Ã¢ÂÂWater security has a big role to play in Sri Lanka and I think the Government has taken the right step when we talk about these mega projects.Ã¢ÂÂ
Virtual water
While Government oversight in water resource management is undoubtedly critical, it is not the only facet of improving water security. As highlighted by the populace of Cape Town, South Africa, sometimes the most effective method is found by looking inward.
South AfricaÃ¢ÂÂs largest city was due to run out of water by August this year, but having realised the extent of the problem a year earlier, the Government raised awareness by announcing a Ã¢ÂÂday zeroÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a point at which taps would run dry. This shocked the population into action, and through a several measures such reusing shower water, limiting toilet flushing and night-time irrigation, AfricaÃ¢ÂÂs second city was saved from running dry.
While such extreme measures are not needed yet in Sri Lanka, itÃ¢ÂÂs never too late to begin paying attention to your water footprint. This is where the idea of virtual water Ã¢ÂÂ sometimes referred to as food water or invisible water Ã¢ÂÂ comes in, a concept which looks to raise awareness on the hidden cost of water in everyday life.
Ã¢ÂÂFood water is water needed to produce food. About 92% of the water we consume is food water. The remaining 8% is for industry and domestic use. That is of course a global figure which will vary from country to country,Ã¢ÂÂ explains Professor Tony Allen, Emeritus Professor Department of Geography at KingÃ¢ÂÂs College London.Allen was named the 2008 Stockholm Water Prize Laureate, having pioneered the development of key concepts in the understanding and communication of water issues and how they are linked to agriculture Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂvirtual waterÃ¢ÂÂ, climate change, economics and politics.
He too advocates the need for individuals to realise their own water footprints, without solely depending on the Government. Be it eating less meat, or possibly buying smartphones less frequently Ã¢ÂÂ a single smartphone takes roughly 13 tons of water to produce Ã¢ÂÂ we can all do our part.
Ã¢ÂÂIf youÃ¢ÂÂre vegetarian you need about 2,500 cubic metres of water a day, if youÃ¢ÂÂre a heavy meat eater you need 5,000. We as consumers in the food system do consume in ways that are very bad for the ecology and our planet. If we eat sensibly we can clearly have a different footprint. You need to recognise that your food security does depend on your assistance, so do look internally if you want effective water resource management.Ã¢ÂÂ

The killing of Avni has outraged people across the nation because, in a sense, it represents the same senseless violence that appears to have gripped us in recent years. And the politics behind this tragic killing appears to have the same sense of dÃÂ©jÃ vu. How people in power use a conflict situation as an opportunity to grab land (hundreds of hectares of precious forest land in this case) and sell it at a throwaway price to their business cronies. And, once again, the same names reappear as beneficiaries.But letÃ¢ÂÂs start at the beginning. Who was Avni? Avni was a six-year-old tigress, the mother of two ten-month-old cubs. She was officially known as T1.AvniÃ¢ÂÂs home was Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district. Pandharkawada is a small forest being rapidly encroached upon by the locals as well as those who come in search of lime, coal and. For a mere Rs 40 crore, almost 500 hectares of the forest was given away (you could say almost gifted) by the government to, currently much in the news for the Dassault offsets. Ambani was to set up a cement plant there. The plant, of course, got promptly sold offÃ¢ÂÂlock, stock and barrelÃ¢ÂÂto another business house for Rs 4,800 crore, thus benchmarking the landÃ¢ÂÂs actual value.While Avni and her mate were planning a family, which would have in turn grown the tiger population in the forest, several industrial groups were also eyeing the land. There was another cement plant coming up thereÃ¢ÂÂas well as a power plant. Others were also lining up, eager to grab a part of the forest and, as we all know, there were ministers in the Congress (and in the current BJP) always ready to sign away forest land. It is a big business today. But Avni didnÃ¢ÂÂt know that. She saw it as her home.Luckily, tiger habitats are not easy to give awayÃ¢ÂÂfor the tiger is a protected species. So Avni became a headache. There was only one way to get rid of herÃ¢ÂÂto spread the lie that she was a man-eater. That is very easy to do in a place like Yavatmal, often referred to as IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs suicide capital. Years of neglect of local farmers, successive droughts, lack of irrigation, missed monsoons, mounting debts and frequent crop failures have brought the region to its knees. Promised loan reliefs never came. Things are so bad there that people are even ready to kill themselves for a paltry compensation so that their families may live. In this tragic (and unfortunate) situation, claiming compensation from wildlife deaths could fetch someoneÃ¢ÂÂs family three times more money than death from drinking pesticide or hanging from a tree.That is why it was convenient to pin the moniker of a man-eater on Avni. Every death that took place out there, natural or unnatural, began to be attributed to her.This campaign was started by the tateÃ¢ÂÂs minister of forests himself, Sudhir Mungantiwar, who has been accused by his own party leader Maneka Gandhi (a former Union minister of environment and forests and renowned for her work among animals) of being on a killing spree since he became minister. Ã¢ÂÂI am shockedÃ¢ÂÂ, she said, Ã¢ÂÂthat such a man is allowed to hold this portfolio.Ã¢ÂÂ She also pointed out that the murder of AvniÃ¢ÂÂ stealthily and in the dead of night, violating every wildlife law of the countryÃ¢ÂÂ was Ã¢ÂÂnothing but a straight case of crime. Despite requests from his own forest department and people all over India, Mungantiwar gave the order to kill.Ã¢ÂÂAnd whom did he hire for the kill? A shooter called Nawab Shafat Ali Khan from Hyderabad, with a history of many run-ins with the law. In 2005, the Karnataka CID (forests) caught him for illegal shooting expeditionsÃ¢ÂÂpunishable under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. KSN Chikkerur, former inspector general of CID (forests), described him as Ã¢ÂÂa very trigger-happy manÃ¢ÂÂ. But the charges against him are not just limited to poaching. In 1991-92, the Karnataka police had arrested him for allegedly supplying weapons to Maoists operating along the Andhra-Odisha boundary.To justify the killing, recent deaths in the region were blamed on AvniÃ¢ÂÂall 13 of them. DNA tests, however, were only done on three, and two of them showed signs of a tiger kill. But none of those tests conclusively proved it was Avni who was responsible.Yet, the campaign continued. Stories were spread about how Avni had become athreat. By law, a man-eater is a tiger that kills humans for food and, till the very end, there was no evidence that Avni had ever killed humans for food. In fact, conservationists will tell you that tigers see humans as predators, not prey. The notion of a man-eater is ridiculously old-fashioned, created by the British to justify hunting. But Mungantiwar kept shouting from the rooftops. And as the rumours grew,were laid out on how to kill Avni. The Nawab was brought in. His CV declared that he had killed 250in Bihar in public interest.Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Preeti S Menon has, in an article, described how many NGOs were ready to offer tonnes of fodder to the villagers to stop them from grazing in the forest and there was even a proposal to solar-fence the forest zone. But the minister was adamant. Avni had to go. Even the courts urged restraint. Maneka Gandhi promised to bring in an expert team from Madhya Pradesh to tranquilise and relocate Avni. But the minister kept assuring everyone that the Nawab would only be an observer while the veterinary teams would trap the tigress and her cubs, as per the law.What finally happened was a coldblooded murder. The NawabÃ¢ÂÂs sonÃ¢ÂÂAsghar Ali, who (some claim) was not even authorisedÃ¢ÂÂslunk into the forest in the night, violating all regulations, and shot Avni dead. Like in all fake encounters, the excuse was lame: The tigress attacked us. What did you expect it to do when you sneaked up on her and her cubs at night? Those who have examined the body say a tranquiliser gun was fired at her after she had been killed, to prove that attempts were made to capture her alive. And all this while the law says you cannot tranquilise at night.Avni is dead. Her cubs lie orphaned and will probably die. They are too young to hunt for food on their own. The minister is strutting around, boasting his decision. And the forests, as usual, are up for sale, while the locals barely manage to eke out their indigent existence.The people want a probe. They want the forests minister to go. But will he have the dignity to step down? Or will the chief minister take a call on this?",Avni: A wanton killing

26,183,positive,"Bengaluru: Heavy, incessant rainfall is a fact of life for the people of Kodagu (the erstwhile Coorg district) in Karnataka.

""For the old-timers here in Coorg, the last few months of rain was nothing new. None of us were really expecting such incredible damage to happen though,"" said Pavita Subbaiah, a resident of Madikeri. Subbaiah and her husband had shifted back to Kodagu five years ago, after he had retired from his job at Bengaluru.

""Everyone thinks the reason for all this damage and loss of life is the buildings that have come up everywhere and the constant use of earthmovers and drillers. A fragile region like ours just cannot take that much pressure,"" she adds.

The district of Kodagu is indeed used to heavy rains, especially when the Southwest monsoons traverses it during its journey across the Indian subcontinent. Thus, when heavy rains battered the region in June this year and continued over the next few months, there was an apprehension about loss of good coffee crop (Karnataka grows more than 50 percent of India's coffee) but no one was thinking of extensive damage, lesser still about entire villages being consumed by landslides. It was the mid-August rains that began on Independence Day, August 15, and continued unabated till August 17, that broke the levee, quite literally.

Over the course of three days, August 15, 16 and 17, Kodagu received 768 mm of rainfall. This is almost half of the entire rainfall received in August, which was 1,675 mm. The rainfall recorded in August 2018 broke all records in living memory - it was back in 1931 that Kodagu had last received such heavy rainfall. Even then, August 1931 had recorded 1,559 mm of rainfall. The fact that this time most of the rain fell over a period of 72 hours made things worse.

The higher altitude towns and villages in the region just couldn't handle the rains. A third of all the panchayats in Kodagu were critically affected. At least 14 people were reported dead, more than 5,000 people were in rescue camps in the first few days after the rains, crop damages alone was estimated to be more than Rs 3 billion (Rs 300 crore).

A few villages in the worst-affected municipalities, Kushalnagar and Madikeri, have been completely submerged by landslides with no traces left of homes or farmland.

Kodagu is a region most famous for its coffee beans, martial prowess and, of course, for being the birthplace of the Cauvery - the river that is the lifeline for millions of farmers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The district varies in altitude from 390 metres above mean sea level (MSL) up to 1,750 metres above MSL. Over the last decade or so, Kodagu has also seen a great inflow of tourists, with city slickers from Bengaluru and other urban centres driving down for weekend holidays. The number of home stays in Kodagu has mushroomed to keep up with the tourists and, as of now, every other coffee estate in the region doubles up as a home stay.

A senior forest official in Karnataka who declined to be named said that excessive tourism is detrimental to the environment but also argued that other underlying factors are not even discussed.

""In line with the global trend of deforestation and forest degradation, much forest area (mostly government lands) came under coffee cultivation in the last three decades in Kodagu,"" he said. ""The governance was under tremendous pressure to facilitate development. There was no stopping this trend as the priority of governance was not in regulating and containing encroachments or unbridled development but to regularise and promote it.""

The official added, ""Since coffee cultivation is under shade of trees, deforestation was less visible to satellite imagery and less visually arresting. The landslides have primarily happened in the revenue villages of Mukkodlu, Galibeedu, Kalur, Monnangeri and Madapur. These are some of the areas that have been recently deforested. Deforestation in Kodagu is cryptic and happens below the radar. The landscape remains green and the canopy cover shows little change, but the land below changes significantly.""

According to the Coffee Board of India, Kodagu accounts for 107,089 hectares of the 2,44,785 hectares of coffee plantations in Karnataka, the state which accounts for over 53 percent of India's coffee production. Thus, if this deforestation is a reality, it is happening at an overwhelming scale.

All the talk and focus in Kodagu right now is about getting the district back on its feet. The region is still reeling from the disaster with 25 relief camps acting as temporary homes to about 3,000 victims. At least five people are missing and the search is still on for them. The state electricity board is trying to get their services up and running but heavy landslides and damage to arterial roads is proving to be a major impediment.

As Kodagu recovers, there is talk about reviving the recommendations made by committees such as the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (popularly known as the Gadgil committee report). The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) not to reduce the eco-sensitive area (ESA) of Western Ghats further from the proposed 56,825 sq kms and to notify the same within six months.

These are signs of acknowledging that anthropogenic activities should be reduced in regions such as Kodagu. Whether this will translate effectively on the ground is still questionable.",Respecting environment crucial to rebuilding safe Kodagu

The Union Secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources has been asked to notify the policy within four weeks.
Stating that despite previous orders, the authorities have failed to curb groundwater extraction by industries and other stakeholders, the Bench added, Ã¢ÂÂThe tribunal has passed several orders prohibiting extraction of groundwater. No adequate steps have been taken for recharge of groundwater. Discharges from industries are ridiculous and beyond comprehension in over-exploited, critical and semi-critical areas.Ã¢ÂÂ
During the hearing, the green panel also suggested that treated sewage water be provided to agriculturists instead of potable water.
The suggestion came after the tribunal was informed that over 90% of groundwater extraction is done by agriculturists.

Ã¢ÂÂMajor part of the population is still in rural areas. Find a viable alternative by which agriculturists are not adversely affected and the limited resources of the country are also saved.

In response to a submission that a fee is charged from industries extracting groundwater, the Bench said, Ã¢ÂÂYou cannot take money for committing offence and it is not deterrence. It has to be completely stopped. There cannot be a fee taken and permission given.Ã¢ÂÂ

A male leopard was found dead in Sahara CityÃ¢ÂÂs Aamby Valley early on Sunday, after it got ensnared in a trap set by poachers, forest officials said. This is the second leopard death in Pune in the last 30 days.
According to Vivek Khandekar, chief conservator of forests, Pune, the leopard possibly got trapped on Saturday night in Aamby Valley, a high-end private city near Lonavla. Villagers heard the leopard roar early on Sunday and found it dead on reaching the spot. Ã¢ÂÂFrom the initial reports it is clear that the leopard was stuck in a trap set by the poachers. The premises being a protected area, no one had any knowledge of the incident until the local villagers informed forest officers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Khandekar.
Earlier in November, a leopard was found dead in Daund, however, the officials termed it a natural death. Ã¢ÂÂA post mortem will be carried out and viscera will be sent to a forensic lab in Mumbai. We will send a notice to Sahara City as this is the second time such incident on the property and they have not cooperated with forest officials...,Ã¢ÂÂ said Khandekar.
According to forest officials, three teams have been formed to search for similar metal traps set by poachers in the Maval taluka, where Aamby Valley is located. A search has also been launched to nab the culprits.
Meanwhile, another leopard in Junnar was injured after a speeding vehicle rammed into it on Saturday evening. The accident has left the leopard with leg injuries.

30,221,positive,"To speed up land acquisition for its major road projects, the Maharashra cabinet on Tuesday sanctioned the issue of a government resolution amending the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.

The proposed amendment and the GR will help the government acquire land despite opposition from farmers and other affected residents.

This will bring the land acquisition process for state highways, district roads, village roads and highways with special status under the Maharashtra Highways Act, 1955, allowing the government to eliminate the conducting of social impact assessments (SIA) and also to acquire irrigated and multi-crop land.

Ã¢ÂÂMany cities are caught in a Ã¢ÂÂperfect stormÃ¢ÂÂ of population growth, escalating adaptation needs and substantial development deficits created by a shortage of human and financial resources, increasing levels of informality, poor governance, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, poverty and growing inequalityÃ¢ÂÂ, noted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014. The flood disasters in various parts of India, especially the recent events in Kerala, only reiterate this statement.

The 2018 floods in Kerala have no parallels in the stateÃ¢ÂÂs recent history; the last such was in 1924. The intensity of flooding then was probably the same but with a much lower impact. What has changed between 1924 and now? I recount the backdrop of my small village named Thalayolaparambu in central Kerala. Built in 1934, my riverside home was in the middle of a large coconut plantation, bordered all around by canals. The compound was flooded during most monsoons but not our home, built a couple of meters above the ground, probably based on the experience of the 1924 floods. Over the years, the region has been transformed and the numerous canals have been reclaimed, to make approach roads. The 2018 flood inundated the ground floor of most houses in this region, but spared ours.

A narrow strip of land with its highlands transforming to steep slopes, midlands and coastal tracts, Kerala it picturesque, and is a favourite destination for tourists. But this topography is also sensitive to anthropogenic alterations. Construction projects, deforestation and excessive quarrying affect the stability of hilly regions. Madhav Gadgil (former professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore), an expert on Western Ghats ecology, shared his concern recently that Ã¢ÂÂrainfall is the natural trigger, but the severity of outcome is entirely man madeÃ¢ÂÂ.

Reclaiming of wetlands, conversion of paddy fields and alteration of flood plains are the most widely accepted reasons for flooding, as in the case of the Cochin International Airport, which had to be closed due to water logging. It is ironic that the airport has been awarded with the highest environmental honour Ã¢ÂÂChampion of Earth Prize -2018Ã¢ÂÂ by the United Nations, for its operations based on solar power, with panels installed on reclaimed wetlands and former paddy fields. The airport is just about 400 metres from the Periyar river, the longest in the state and with the largest discharge potential. Local people point out how a creek --- Chengal Thodu --- and three irrigation canals were realigned to make space for the runway, which is now flooded. It is not unusual that runways get flooded, and for airports remain closed following intense rains, as it has happened in other airports of India and elsewhere in the world. But what happened at the Cochin airport is an example of a river recapturing its flood plains.

There are other examples: the 2013 Uttarakhand flood, which happened due to a cloudburst, was followed by numerous landslides. The river overflow was caused by the intensity of the rainfall together with the blockages in the river due to debris. There are also numerous urban examples like the 2015 Chennai flood. As with most urban floods, the anthropogenic factors for the Chennai flood far outweigh the natural causes. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India blamed the authorities for the unplanned development by encroachment of lakes and river floodplains. The same is the story with metros like Mumbai and even Bengaluru (geographically better positioned as it is away from the sea and at a higher elevation). Clogged drainages, unplanned underpasses, shrinking wetlands, fading green cover, vanishing lakes and other inherent problems of urbanisation are considered as the culprits.

Although the reasons and zones of impact may vary, there are many common underlying reasons, such as unplanned and excessive development, poor management of tourism, reduction in forest cover and encroachment of water bodies and wetlands. We all know that development comes with a cost, but as tragedies of such dimensions strike, it is the poor who suffer the most. The biggest lesson from the recent flood is that developmental agenda should be sustainable, transparent, socially and economically inclusive and protective of ecological systems.

Prime minister at a rally in Mandsaur
MANDSAUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday attempted to soothe farmersÃ¢ÂÂ sentiments and claimed that BJP government in the state has brought in schemes to increase farm profitability, unlike the Ã¢ÂÂfalse promisesÃ¢ÂÂ of Congress about loan waivers.The Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs statements came at a poll rally in Mandsaur Ã¢ÂÂ the epicentre of the 2017 violent agitation that shook ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh to take drastic measures to save face.AICC president Rahul Gandhi, who since the agitation had held two rallies Ã¢ÂÂ one to commemorate the death of seven farmers and the other during canvassing - had pitched farmersÃ¢ÂÂ plight as a poll issue. He later had promised waiver of farm loans within 10 days of the formation of Congress government in the state.Modi accused Congress of making false promises and said it was the BJP government that brought down the interest of farm loans from 15-6 per cent to zero per cent. Ã¢ÂÂYou (Congress) had made farmers debt-ridden. We made them strong,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.The prime minister referred to farmersÃ¢ÂÂ agitation in Karnataka and accused Congress of failing to waive farm loans in the southern state after coming to power. Ã¢ÂÂThe farmers are being sent warrants and put in jails,Ã¢ÂÂ he alleged.The prime minister claimed that Congress had made similar promises in the 2009 general elections. It had promised to waive loans to the tune of Rs 6 lakh crore, but loans worth barely Rs 60,000 crore were waived.He laid down the achievements of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh in expanding irrigated areas and said it would take 200-250 years for Congress to do what Chouhan did in the state in last 15 years.Modi claimed that decades of apathy shown by Congress about farmersÃ¢ÂÂ welfare has led to a situation that is making the job for BJP governments difficult of making agriculture profitable.He referred to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel as the foremost well wishes of farmers and said, Ã¢ÂÂHad Patel been the first prime minister of the country, the plight of farmers would have been such. Decades of the wrong done by Congress is now defaming our governments.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂIt takes time to correct the wrongdoing,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.",Congress making false promises to farmers: PM Narendra Modi

36,238,positive,"NEW DELHI/ SHILLONG: Coal baron and Congress MP Vincent H Pala has urged the Centre to regularise rat-hole mining to avoid accidents such as the Ksan mine tragedy.
The senior Congress leader, who was speaking on the floor of the Lok Sabha on Thursday, said many people were indulging in illegal rat-hole mining Ã¢ÂÂin the hope of it being regularised soon as was promised by the BJP in its manifestoÃ¢ÂÂ.
When asked whether PalaÃ¢ÂÂs demand was justified, local environmentalist Toki Blah said, Ã¢ÂÂWhat do you mean by regularization? It does not make sense.Ã¢ÂÂ
It should not make sense as rat-hole mining is the crudest form of mining that is practised in an unorganised way without proper safety measures. The miners who crawl into the rat holes are usually without safety equipment.
The BJP in its poll manifesto had said it would solve the mining issue within 180 days if it was voted to power. It, however, did not mention about regularising rat-hole mining.
Stating that this form of mining is unscientific and causes environmental hazards, besides killing the river system, Blah said no one is against coal mining but proper technology should be used for doing so.
Ã¢ÂÂBring in some new and improved technological system that will protect the environment, lives and provide safety,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
When asked if the Congress shared PalaÃ¢ÂÂs views on rat-hole mining, Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee chief Celestine Lyngdoh said, Ã¢ÂÂI am not an expert. The government should sit and plan out what is the best solution.Ã¢ÂÂ
Earlier in the day, NPP state president WR Kharlukhi, while asking AICC chief Rahul Gandhi not to play politics over coal mining in Jaintia Hills, said Ã¢ÂÂit is the bread and butterÃ¢ÂÂ of many people. He reiterated that the government was trying its best to rescue the 15 trapped miners.
Kharlukhi pointed out that even former chief ministers like BB Lyngdoh and PA Sangma had tried to regulate coal mining in Meghalaya but rat-hole mining continued and Ã¢ÂÂit has been taking place in Jaintia Hills for agesÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂI urge the government to regularise rat-hole mining as promised to avoid such accidents in future,Ã¢ÂÂ Pala said in the House on Thursday.
On the sluggish rescue operation, Pala said though the rescue officers have done their best they have been unable to rescue any miner because at least 10 pumps of 100 HP each is required to pump out the water seeping into the mine.
Ã¢ÂÂThe rescue team has only two pumps of 25 HP at its disposal. The state as well as the central government has failed to provide 10 high power pumps and other equipment in order to fast-track the process of sucking water out of the mine,Ã¢ÂÂ he alleged.
The Shillong MP informed the House that there was no accurate number of miners who are trapped because those who managed to come out have fled due to fear of arrest.
The locals are also unwilling to help because of police action and they should not be arrested, which will affect the ongoing rescue work, he added.
Pala first gave a notice in the form of adjournment motion, which was not allowed.

Whatever the amount, said the 55-year-old, it will not be enough to replace the value of the fertile land feeding his family of six in Pidarwah village, Singrauli district.

He knows of people in nearby villages who moved on the promise by the government and power companies of money, jobs or homes in exchange for their land a decade ago.

Now homeless, they are still waiting for compensation, he said.

Ã¢ÂÂWe can see what happened to those villagers. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve become beggars,Ã¢ÂÂ Saket explained. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not going to let that happen with us.Ã¢ÂÂ

As energy-hungry India seeks to fuel its continued economic growth, millions of people are being robbed of their homes by companies building power plants on their land or mining the coal below it, activists and villagers say.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs energy output has tripled in the last 15 years - according to CARE Ratings, a credit rating agency - making it the worldÃ¢ÂÂs third-largest electricity market.

In Singrauli district alone, more than 1.3 million people have been displaced as the result of government deals with power companies since the 1960s, says Climate Agenda, a local nonprofit.

The government and the power companies often renege on the terms of their land acquisitions, said Priya Pillai, a senior researcher at Asar Social Impact Advisors, a sustainable energy consultancy, who has worked for several years in Singrauli.

Ã¢ÂÂThe biggest problems in the area are displacement, a lack of livelihood and environmental degradation,Ã¢ÂÂ Pillai told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Ã¢ÂÂMines (have) destroyed entire lives and whatever was promised in return never happened.Ã¢ÂÂ

The government led the first wave of displacements in the mid-1950s to build the 300-megawatt Rihand Dam, said Ravi Shekhar, a campaigner with Climate Agenda.

Lured by the steady electricity supply, private and state-owned companies soon followed, he said.

Some families have been moved as many as four times to accommodate energy projects, he added.

Fighting for compensation

More than a decade after the government allocated land to Indian power company Essar Power across four villages in Mahan, a forest area in Singrauli district, locals say they are still waiting for their dues.

Sitapati Singh, a resident of Khairahi village, said she was told by government and Essar representatives that she was a minor when the deal went through, making her ineligible for any compensation. She insists she was over 18 at the time.

Such disputes are common. According to Land Conflict Watch - a New Delhi-based research initiative - as of October, about 7.2 million people have been affected in more than 600 ongoing land disputes across India, involving investments worth $179 billion.

Ã¢ÂÂOne of the biggest (issues) with land and environment is that none of the procedures that are meant to be followed are followed Ã¢ÂÂ¦ That leads to conflict,Ã¢ÂÂ said Kanchi Kohli, a researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank.

Ã¢ÂÂThe transition is inhuman. You dislocate someone from a place and take completely no responsibility for it,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.

An Essar spokesman said by email that the state government and the district administration had identified and acquired the land for its power plant and the company paid for compensation under the guidance of the administration.

Ã¢ÂÂAll the eligible villagers have been duly compensated,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs power ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the rehabilitation procedure for residents affected by power projects.

Complaints

Saket, the farmer in Pidarwah, pointed to villagersÃ¢ÂÂ complaints about EssarÃ¢ÂÂs land deal to explain why he and his neighbours will not sell their land to state-owned power company THDC India Ltd.

According to residents, in November last year villagers attended a meeting called by the government to discuss the proposal.

As per protocol, everyone present had to sign or put their thumbprint on a register to hear about the proposal.

People who were at the meeting said that about 150 villagers attended.

But when they later filed a freedom of information request to look at the register, they saw the signatures and thumbprints of 661 people.

Based on that number of signatures, the company has approval from the villagers to move ahead with the purchase, said A.K. Sharma, additional general manager at THDC.

Villagers said that in the days after the meeting, a village council official tricked people into adding their thumbprints to the register, telling them that he was doing a survey of how many people lived in the area.

Some of the signatures were simply forged, Saket and other Pidarwah residents said.

The villagers have written to government officials with their version of events - a copy of which was seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation - but have not heard back so far.

Anurag Chaudhary, the administrative head of Singrauli district, said that he has not received any complaints from Pidarwah residents but was ready to Ã¢ÂÂresolve any procedural issuesÃ¢ÂÂ.

Ã¢ÂÂThe villagers need to tell me if there is a problem Ã¢ÂÂ¦ I can order an inquiry if anyone complains to me,Ã¢ÂÂ he said by phone.

Sharma said that government officials were currently trying to figure out the best compensation package for the residents of Pidarwah.

Ã¢ÂÂThey donÃ¢ÂÂt need to worry,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, referring to the villagers.

Ã¢ÂÂWe are a government company and the government never deceives.Ã¢ÂÂ

Param Sukh, a former farmer in Singrauli, said that is not his experience. He was about six years old when his family was first moved to another part of the district in the 1950s to make way for the Rihand Dam.

They were displaced again in the 1970s for a state-owned power plant, he said, and were given a 1,500-square-foot plot in the nearby Chilkatand resettlement camp, bordered by a coal mine to the north and a power plant to the south.

They have lived there ever since.

Ã¢ÂÂEarlier we had land, and we could grow our own food, and we were comfortable,Ã¢ÂÂ Sukh said.

Ã¢ÂÂToday we are suffering.Ã¢ÂÂ

As India builds increasingly ambitious projects, analysts say the definition of what constitutes public purpose needs revisiting
Thousands of farmers and indigenous people are being pushed from their homes and losing their livelihoods as India races to build massive statues to lure tourists and appease voters, campaigners said.
In a ceremony featuring fireworks and fighter jets, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week inaugurated the world's tallest statue, of independence hero Vallabhbhai Patel, which towers nearly twice the height of New York's Statue of Liberty.
The 597ft steel and bronze ""Statue of Unity"" was built on the Narmada river in Modi's home state of Gujarat at a cost of about $400 million.
Residents of nearby villages handed a petition to state officials on Monday demanding a halt to further development at the site, according to Rohit Prajapati, an activist who said they are also considering legal action.
""This should be a memorial of violence and violation, to sensitise us to the impact on farmers and indigenous people,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Hundreds of indigenous activists and farmers have held protests at the site in the town of Kevadia, saying the statue is a wasteful extravagance in the midst of poverty, and that those displaced did not receive enough compensation.
""This land, river, forest that your avatar is going to stand on, belongs to Adivasis,"" activist Medha Patkar wrote in a symbolic letter to Patel, who died in 1950, referring to indigenous people.
""They are being cheated and evicted out of their land for tourism,"" she said in the letter published in several newspapers.
The Gujarat government said 185 families were relocated, and that they had received adequate compensation.
The statue is located just a few miles downstream from the Sardar Sarovar Dam, which has been mired in controversy since it was conceived in the 1960s, with protracted battles over water sharing, evictions and compensation.
The dam has displaced 320,000 people and disrupted the lives of tens of thousands more, according to rights group Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save Narmada Campaign).
Thousands have still not been compensated, it has said.
""These are people who are already suffering from the dam's impact, and now they will suffer even more because of the statue. How is this a public purpose?"" said Prajapati, referring to the condition under which the state acquires private land.
As India builds increasingly ambitious projects, analysts say the definition of what constitutes public purpose needs revisiting.
Meanwhile, work is due to begin on a bigger statue of a Hindu king off the coast of Mumbai, which fishermen say will disrupt their catch and affect their livelihood.
The 212-metre tall memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji is scheduled to be unveiled in two years.

In July, the New York Times released Ã¢ÂÂSearching for SaraswatiÃ¢ÂÂ, a 20-minute documentary, directed by Shirley Abraham and Amit Madheshiya. The extremely well made and engaging documentary captures the state-sanctioned search for a mythical river, Saraswati, in two villages in Haryana. The filmmakers deftly draw a picture of people hypnotised by blind faith, and the opportunistic politicians and religious leaders swooping down on the villages for profit and propaganda.

A few days before the documentaryÃ¢ÂÂs worldwide release, I spoke to the two directors. Among the many issues that we discussed over a long-distance call (the duo was in Amsterdam), I remember them asking a rhetorical question: Ã¢ÂÂWhat is the public utility of finding that river [Saraswati]? Who goes to find a river when our existing rivers are dying?Ã¢ÂÂ (Amit clarified that his film does not doubt peopleÃ¢ÂÂs faith. But spending taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money on a project like this defies logic). I agreed.

THE CPCB REPORT

Our rivers are dying. So are the ecosystems that feed them.

A recent report released by the Central Pollution Control Board once again reveals the sorry state of affairs:

MORE POLLUTED STRETCHES: The number of polluted stretches in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs rivers has increased to 351 from 302 two years ago, and the number of critically polluted stretches Ã¢ÂÂ where water quality indicators are the poorest Ã¢ÂÂ has gone up to 45 from 34 in 28 states and six Union Territories. Based on the recommendations of the National Green Tribunal, the CPCB last month appraised the states of the extent of pollution in their rivers.

This is alarming but this is not the true state of our rivers, say river experts.

The truth is much worse, when other factors (disappearing flows, increasing number of structures and diversions, sand mining, disappearing biodiversity, deleterious projects underway and planned etc) more than mere water quality (as is the limited mandate of CPCB) are considered. Except a few uphill and select stretches of tributaries of a few major rivers, mostly all rivers are in a bad shape.

THE TOP OFFENDERS: While the Rs 20,000 crore clean-up of the Ganga may be the most visible of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to tackle pollution, the CPCB says several of the riverÃ¢ÂÂs stretches Ã¢ÂÂ in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh Ã¢ÂÂ are far less polluted than many rivers in Maharashtra, Assam, and Gujarat. These three states account for 117 of the 351 polluted river stretches.

Ã¢ÂÂThis is no surprise since these are high and increasingly industrialised and urbanised states, but the increase in Assam is intriguing. Perhaps it is in Assam that the observations points have seen a greater increase,Ã¢ÂÂ says former forester-turned-river crusader Manoj Misra.

LACK OF EFFECTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT:

A Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report of 2015, reported in the Centre for Science and EnvironmentÃ¢ÂÂs State of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Environment 2018 report, brought out the fact that 61,948 million litres of urban sewage is generated on a daily basis in India. But the cities have an installed sewage treatment capacity of only 38% of this.

In reality, more than this amount goes untreated into the rivers or water bodies as the treatment capacity of major sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the country is around 66% of the installed capacity as per CPCB findings of 2013. As a result, more than 38,000 million litres of wastewater goes into the major rivers, water bodies and even percolates into the ground every day.

Over and above this there is industrial effluent. The data on the raw sewage from rural areas are not available.

The national obsession with Ã¢ÂÂcleaningÃ¢ÂÂ of rivers will land us only at its water quality assessment. Unfortunately, other key threats to rivers as an ecological entity are ignored.

Ã¢ÂÂThus the magic word should be rejuvenation and not just Ã¢ÂÂcleaningÃ¢ÂÂ. This is because a clean river is an automatic corollary of a rejuvenated river. But the latter is also far more sustainable in its outcome,Ã¢ÂÂ adds Misra.

The government will launch a mass contact programme of agriculture officials meeting farmers in every village educating them on various aspects of farming and mechanization from August 15. The insurance scheme for all farmers with Rs 5 lakh risk coverage will also take off on the same day.

At a review meeting on the arrangements made for the meeting with all agriculture officials on June 4 in the city, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao instructed the officials to organize village-level meetings with farmers and find out difficulties faced by them in farming.

Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) in every mandal were asked to take the responsibility of setting up of each cluster towards establishing crop colonies, mechanization and also food processing units. Local MPs, MLAs and MLCs will also participate in these meetings.

The AEO will educate the farmer in his cluster on the cropping pattern and about the best crop that suits the soil, etc. The AEO will also coordinate the marketing facility on the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ produce both within and outside the state.

The officials have also been entrusted to monitor the distribution of LIC bonds to the farmers under the insurance scheme to be launched on August 15.

KCR said each AEO has been entrusted with looking after a cluster of 5000 acres. The officials will have a detailed information of all the farmers in the cluster and the entire information of all the clusters should be on the table of the Agriculture Minister.

KCR said farmers are in the habit of preferring cropping in a traditional way which needs to be changed by educating them and also by providing required skill to go for profitable crops. The responsibility of this lies with AEOs. The present scenario of importing flowers, fruits and vegetables should be reversed and Telangana should be in a position to export them, he added.

The Chief Minister favored quick mechanization in the state by assessing the existing facilities and the future requirement. He instructed the officials to see that the required machinery and implements are to be made available to every farmer to make use of them from nursery to harvest. Adequate budget provision will be made for funds next year.

KCR also advised the officials to post letters with Agriculture Minister P Srinivas ReddyÃ¢ÂÂs signature to all the farmers briefing them about the schemes designed and being implemented.","Agri officials to guide farmers on crop pattern, mechanisation"

Many of the fertile land plots are slowly getting converted into commercial residential plots. The booming real estate market and low-income of farmers has threatened the countryÃ¢ÂÂs self-sufficiency programme

The agriculture sector in Nepal has barely progressed in the last decade. As always, plans and policies are limited to papers only. The successive governments, it seems, are oblivious to the agriculture distress that country could face in near future.

Despite being an agriculture-based economy, Nepal is still struggling to cater to the need of the entire country.

Agriculture accounts for more than 30 per cent of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs gross domestic product and is the means of livelihood for more than 60 per cent of the population.

NepalÃ¢ÂÂs import of food grains, particularly rice, increased by a whopping 30 per cent in the fiscal year 2014-15. Also, the import of cereals shot up the same year. Cereal products include beaten rice, buck wheat, millet, barley wheat and corn. On the other hand, large number of families are moving out of farming profession, thanks to the stateÃ¢ÂÂs apathy towards agriculture and small farmers. Given the scenario, the spectre of food insecurity is looming large.

The fundamental issue, which has often been raised in much of agricultural literature, is about the domination of marginal and small land holdings. As we all know, NepalÃ¢ÂÂs agriculture is characterised by preponderance of marginal and small holdings.

Around 74.2 per cent of agricultural holdings are below one hectare. In fact, the Asian Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS) 2010 says 91.7 per cent of the agricultural holdings are less than two hectares, accounting for 68.7 per cent of the total operated area.

The average size of holding is only 0.8 hectare. Hence marginal and small farmers are the protagonists in NepalÃ¢ÂÂs agricultural scenario. In fact, due to the heredity tradition of equal division of land among the inheritors, the number of land parcels is increasing with a decreasing trend in the size of land parcels in Nepal.

The preponderance of small and fragmented holdings may cause serious obstacles for mechanisation of agriculture by reducing the desire of the farmers to invest

in capital goods.

Weather dependent farming is another major and well-known issue that constantly exposes farm households to uncertainty. Weak and delayed monsoon lowers the output significantly, which ultimately hinders the farm income. Majority of farmlands lack proper irrigation mechanism due to which farmers have to rely on monsoon. Sometimes heavy monsoon costs the farmers their land and directs them to crisis.

Similarly, uncertainty in the price of their output is another major setback for them. Hence a good monsoon doesnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily mean higher income for farmers as their productsÃ¢ÂÂ prices are always determined by the traders even though there exists the minimum support price mechanism set up by the government.

So their income level is at the mercy of a handful of traders in their locality. This adds misery to the farm households who are already going through crisis. Existence of multiple players in the supply chain also makes it difficult for farmers.

Generally, farmers do not even get half of the price paid by the final consumer. This has discouraged youths from taking up farming as their profession, which has fuelled out-migration. Steep

rising trends in migration result in dearth of farm labour in villages, which ultimately leads to higher labour wages.

Remittance gives an additional income to farmers and can potentially reduce the financial constraints of farm households and smooth out the cultivation activities. However, the impact of remittance on decision of farm households relating to improving the agricultural practices has a negative spillover effect. Remittance has enabled small farmers to move from farm activities to non-farm activities.

The agriculture extension service which is supposed to have higher penetration level is surprisingly invisible in many villages. Small farmers are not aware about junior technical (JTA) officers in their villages.

Preliminary observation of a few villages in the Tarai districts reveals that JTA officers rarely visit their assigned area. And even if s/he visits, the visit is often restricted to large farmer households. Furthermore, JTA officers are not updated about tackling different problems in crops and new techniques of cultivation.

The domination of large farm households, it seems, is yet another reason the small farmers rarely get subsidized seeds and other inputs from the district agriculture offices. Majority of the local agricultural officers seems to maintain contacts with only larger farmers.

Finally, many of the fertile land plots are slowly getting converted into commercial residential plots. The booming real estate market and low-income of farmers has threatened the countryÃ¢ÂÂs self-sufficiency programme.

Failure to act on time could result in severe agricultural distress and serious cracks in our food security programme. Therefore, the concerned authorities need to come up with clear cut programmes and policies to tackle the issues related to farming in Nepal.

Or else, the ongoing trends are set to serve as recipe for agriculture crisis, which could give rise to food insecurity.

Investigators are using forensic science & behavioural analysis to identify which of these two leopards now locked up at Van Vihar national park killed three kids

BHOPAL: Three kills and two suspects changing their spots. Each of them had equal opportunity, was seen in the vicinity of the kill site and had the same motive. Sounds one for Hercule Poirot A team of investigators is using forensic science and behavioural analysis to identify which of two snarling leopards now locked up at Van Vihar national park killed three children just beyond the outskirts of the state capital last week. Samples of excreta and saliva of both leopards have been collected to match forensic evidence collected from the bodies of those killed on three consecutive nights in Obaidullahganj , some 35km from Bhopal.Both leopards were captured within a radius of 50 metres in a span of 24 hours on March 23 and brought to Van Vihar. Ã¢ÂÂBoth of them are ferocious and it is difficult to make out which is the culprit,Ã¢ÂÂ investigating officer SDO Rajeev Shrivastava told TOI.Shrivastava and his team havenÃ¢ÂÂt ruled out the possibility of a conspiracy Ã¢ÂÂ both leopards may be to blame. And the biggest hurdle for the jungle detectives is the same one that often dogs police: a messed-up crime scene.Ã¢ÂÂBoth the leopards are ferociousÃ¢ÂÂShrivastava said, Ã¢ÂÂDue to destruction of evidence on the spot by villagers, our only hope are the samples of saliva and excreta of the two leopards. If these match those collected from the bodies and around the kills, weÃ¢ÂÂll know which leopard killed them.Ã¢ÂÂ The samples were sent to FSL Jabalpur on March 25.The first kill took place on the intervening night of March 17-18 in which a 12-year-old boy was mauled to death by a leopard in Bagdihi. Ã¢ÂÂVillagers were the first to reach the spot and carry away the body, thus destroying evidence,Ã¢ÂÂ said Shrivastava, adding that officials were looking for hair of the big cat, which might have been shed during the attack, but the entire area was trampled by villagers. The locals did it out of ignorance.Barely 24 hours after the childÃ¢ÂÂs death, the mangled body of an 18-year-old girl was found in Dagdaga village of Obaidullahganj, just 2km from the previous kill. The villagers chased the beast away which left teenagerÃ¢ÂÂs bleeding body. She died within seconds. A third attack was reported on March 19 in Khidki Ghati village.The next day, forest officials trapped a leopard near the Bagdihi scene of crime. They thought their work was over until they chanced upon pugmarks of another leopard in the vicinity. A frantic search ensued. The area was cordoned off, and on March 22, the second leopard was caught. The first one was brought to Van Vihar on March 21, and the second one on March 23.The forest department is also studying the behavioural pattern of both animals to see if they can identify any telltale signs. The profiling will be carried out over 20 days, sources said. Dr Shrivastava, who has been closely observing the behaviour of the two leopards, said both are ferocious. Ã¢ÂÂAn analyst will be within sight of the leopards continuously for a minimum 20 days,Ã¢ÂÂ said an official, explaining that this will help graph the behavioural movement of the beasts. Ã¢ÂÂIf any of the leopards mellows during the course of study, he will be absolved from guilt. On the other hand, if a leopard remains ferocious all through, it may be an indication that he sees humans as prey,Ã¢ÂÂ the official said, adding that it is not foolproof deduction, and they are banking on DNA analysis.The one found guilty will have to spend the rest of his life at Van Vihar.

Chennai: Crocodiles swarming the Nedungundram lake in Tamil Nadu's capital city have terrorised locals who have urged the forest department to relocate the reptiles, they say pose danger to their lives. Villagers living near Tambaram and Velechery on Friday summoned forest rangers and informed them about the threat looming over their settlements.
According to a report by Deccan Herald, officials with the forest department responded to the residents' pleas by asking for some time to relocate the reptiles. The matter reportedly came to light earlier this week after a local went into the lake to take a bath. However, he came running out of the lake and told his fellow villagers that he sensed 'something unusual' inside the lake.

Once forest rangers reached the Nedungundram lake, villagers who at first thought that the unusual thing was a ""clay mound"" examined the water body closely only to find out that the lake was swarming with crocodiles. Locals told regional media outlets that they are used to the presence of reptiles in the area as the forest department has rescued large crocodiles from the area in the past. One villager said that the crocodiles usually move to land at night-time and are often seen resting outside the homes of villagers in the area.
A news report from September 6, 2014 by the Deccan Chronicle mentions the forest department's capture of a 7-foot-long crocodile at the Sathanandhapuram lake near Tambran in Tamil Nadu. The report goes further to claim that the massive reptile was the seventh crocodile to have been captured from the area since 2016.

The Maharashtra government on Monday formed a one-member judicial committee headed by retired high court judge Kishor Rohi to conduct a probe into the alleged Kharghar land scam.
According to the Opposition, a 24-acre City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) plot, worth Ã¢ÂÂ¹1,768 crore, was allotted to farmers affected by the Koyna power project, and they were later allowed to illegally sell it to a private builder for Ã¢ÂÂ¹3.6 crore. The Opposition alleged the builder is close to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Prasad Lad. Both chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Lad had denied the allegations.
After the issue was raised in the monsoon session of the state legislature, Fadnavis in July announced that a committee would be formed. According to the government resolution (GR) issued by the state urban development department (UDD) that ordered the probe, the panel will check the ownership of the plot; the legality of the allotments, and land transfer, among others.
The committee will probe all land allotments made in the past 15 years to those hit by the Koyna project. The panel will look at whether the rules were followed in the allotments, and whether any ineligible person got the land.
Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam expressed unhappiness over the nature of probe. Ã¢ÂÂWe had demanded a probe by a sitting judge of the high court, as it would have given more legal powers to the panel. Fadnavis had announced to stay the transaction related to the land in dispute, but the government has not taken a decision to scrap the deal. We had also demanded action against the officials in Cidco and district collectorate responsible for the land deal. For a fair probe, the officials responsible for the illegal deal need to be sacked and investigation into their role should be included in the terms of reference,Ã¢ÂÂ Nirupam said.

Addressing a huge public meeting at Wardha in Maharashtra on the occasion of the 149th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rahul said that the Bharatiya Janata Party and the prime minister cannot provide employment to Indian youth and fulfill their aspirations.
The Congress president was in an aggressive mood and launched a scathing attack on Modi. He reiterated that though the prime minister claims to be a Chowkidar, he is a Bhagidar in reality.
Rahul recalled how the prime minister, in his August 15 speech, had claimed that India was sleeping till he became the prime minister. ""At that time, I was wondering what the PM was talking about. Why is he insulting Indians by claiming that nothing had been achieved till he became the prime minister?"" asked the Congress leader.
Modi bowed before Mahatma Gandhi today, but in reality he was opposing every Gandhian thought and spreading anger and hatred, said the Amethi MP.
""Truth was very important to Gandhiji. Our prime minister had promised Rs 15 lakh; he had promised two crore jobs; he had also promised fair price to agricultural produce. Did you get any of these? Is our prime minister talking the truth then?,"" Rahul asked the audience.
Turning to the controversial Rafale deal, Rahul said that the prime minister should at least once explain on what basis he gave the contract to Anil Ambani's firm. ""The prime minister gave him (Ambani) Rs 30,000 crore that belonged to the youth and farmers of this country. Anil Ambani has never made any aircraft, but he was chosen over HAL that has 70 years of experience in aircraft making. Ambani's company was formed ten days before he got the contract and now the former president of France has also said that the Indian government told France and Dassault to choose Anil Ambani as partner. The prime minister is lying, he has helped Anil Ambani,"" lambasted Rahul.
He also alleged that in the last four years, loans to the tune of Rs 3.2lakh crore, borrowed by 15-20 chosen businessmen, were waived, but the government was not waiving loans of farmers.
""Did you see a single person in suit and boot standing in the queue after notebandi? Rich friends of Modiji like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi entered the banks through the back door entrance and converted their black money into white. The prime minister took your money and gave it to them. Yeh chowkidari nahi bhaagidari hai,"" the Congress president lashed out.
He also said that the Congress will listen to people's Mann Ki Baat. ""If you want to listen to Mann Ki Baat, the audios are available. We will never tell you our Mann Ki Baat, we will instead listen to you.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Ahmed Patel on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protect the rights of farmers and farm labourers while acquiring land in southern Gujarat for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.In a letter to the prime minister, Patel said farmers' representatives had complained that rules and procedures under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 were not being adhered to while acquiring land for the project.He alleged that meetings were being conducted barely at a day's notice, without appropriate publicity, and this defeated the very purpose of the consultation process, the objective of which was to educate the farmers about the impact of the project and their rights under the Act.""It is extremely unfortunate that the Gujarat government is conducting this entire exercise under the diluted version of the 2013 Land Act, which, in effect, runs contrary to the law passed by Parliament,"" the Congress leader said in his letter.He alleged that under the Gujarat government's regulations, the need for mandatory consent of farmers and a social impact assessment were done away with.The essence of a farmer's right to his or her land, as per the 2013 legislation, rested on the two pillars of consent and an impact assessment report, Patel pointed out.""By doing away with these processes, I am afraid that the entire land acquisition process may descend down to a mere tokenism,"" the Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat said.Patel alleged that the rights of farmers and farm labourers over agricultural land were ""trampled upon"" by large and powerful interests and hence, he added that Parliament had entrusted the Executive to defend the rights of farmers and farm labourers via the 2013 Land Act.""Given that this project is being conducted under the mandate of the central government, I request you to ensure that the 2013 Land Act is implemented in letter and spirit for the said acquisition. Any deviation from the 2013 Land Act will result in grave injustice to the farmers and farm labourers of Gujarat,"" the Congress leader said.""Our objective is not to obstruct the project the government is undertaking. But in the process of building a bullet train, we cannot bulldoze the constitutional rights of farmers. I sincerely hope you will have the matter examined and the needful will be done at the earliest,"" he added.Patel pointed out that the land acquisition process was initiated by the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC) for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.

Fields of many of these farmers were acquired for the construction of the Western Peripheral Expressway, also known as Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway, over a decade ago. They have now opposed the BJP governmentÃ¢ÂÂs proposal to set up five big cities, or panchagram, along the highway. The farmers have alleged that it would render hundreds of farmers and farm labourers jobless and only help developers and industrialists.
Shamsher Singh, a farmer and a resident of Kundal village, said the farmers were not against development in the region, but were demanding that they should also be partners in it. Singh (42) alleged that the government had declared over six lakh hectares of land along the KMP as controlled area without notification and did not specify the purpose as well.
Ã¢ÂÂIt is wrong to snatch lands from farmers and hand those over to big corporates and developers. Any development plan for the area must include the farmers as the partners,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Hans Raj Rana said the proposal to develop the five cities along the highway would render hundreds of people jobless. He also sought to know if the government had any plan for their rehabilitation.
Indefinite dharna
Holding an indefinite dharna at Saidpur Chowk near Kharkhoda village here since February 15, 2011, under the aegis of Bhumi Bachchao Sangarsh Samiti against alleged faulty land acquisition for KMP, Mr. Rana said the farmers in Haryana were facing discrimination. He said that the people living in villages along the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal Expressway were given heftier compensation for land acquired for the construction of the expressway.
Ã¢ÂÂWhile farmers in Uttar Pradesh got Ã¢ÂÂ¹3-4 crore per acre, farmers in five Haryana districts along the road were paid meagre Ã¢ÂÂ¹20-80 lakh per acre. When the purpose of acquisition is the same, why is there a difference in compensation?,Ã¢ÂÂ said the 62-year-old.
Mr. Rana also alleged that the Haryana government had failed to rehabilitate the farmers from whom lands were acquired for the expressway, adding that they were also not paid the annual royalty of Ã¢ÂÂ¹21,000 per acre, as promised.
Singh said that the highway had dissected the lands of various farmers forcing them to take de-tours of several kilometres to reach their own farm. He said irrigation channels at several places were also cut off. He further said that a large number of farmers wanted the KMP to be named after farmersÃ¢ÂÂ leader Sir Chhotu Ram, but their demand was not met by the government.
FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ leader Pradeep Dhankar (47) said there was anger among the farmers for not getting the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops and over imposing of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana on them.
Despite the announcement made by the government, a very small percentage of their crop was bought at the MSP, Mr. Dhankar alleged. He said that farmers were dying by suicide due to crop failures or after not getting the proper price, but there was no political leader to raise voice for them.
Ã¢ÂÂThe share of agriculture in Gross Domestic Product has been rapidly falling and the farmers are only being exploited as voters during the election season,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.",Resentment among farmers ahead of PM visit to Gurugram

These words of one of America's best-known presidents probably inspired a former engineer in India to try to transform what was once a bone-dry region into a green oasis simply by motivating its inhabitants to do what they earlier thought was impossible.

Some 120 km from Bengaluru in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, the village, of which little was known previously with no signboards even indicating its location to outsiders, has now become famous through its self-sustaining model. The dozen families here grow crops organically, meet their energy needs entirely by tapping wind power, harvest rain to conserve water and supply it to their homes with a solar-powered pump.

What's more, the village boasts of a Wi-Fi facility, provides entrepreneurial opportunities to farmers and has its own syllabus for children to hone their skills rather than learning by rote.

Even as many parts of rural India still lack rudimentary amenities, the sustainable development model of this small hamlet makes it an example when it comes to water conservation, power generation, ending gender bias and even eliminating casteism.

As water depleted in the rocky soil and farming became tough in the semi-arid zone, villages in the district despaired as people deserted them and migrated to cities for livelihood.

That was when 39-year-old Kalyan Akkipeddi -- who gave up a lucrative job in the finance and marketing division at General Electric to travel around the country's villages in search of knowledge -- arrived at remote Tekulodu.

Inspired by the simple life of tribals that he had witnessed during his travels, Akkipeddi chose to ""intern"" with a farmer family in Tekulodu and helped them increase their income from Rs 7,000 a year to about Rs 14,000 a month by putting scientific practices to work and tapping natural resources like solar and wind power.

In 2013, he bought a 12.5-acre plot of land a few kilometres from Tekulodu, on the forest fringe near his home town Hindupur, in the same district of the Rayalaseema region. This has evolved into what he named ProtoVillage -- the prototype of an ideal village.

""I was so inspired by what I saw in the tribal communities. Their wisdom allowed them to live in synergy with their surroundings. I thought of demonstrating that kind of life based on three simple principles -- a deep respect for soil, air and water, inter-dependence and, as a result, self-reliance,"" Akkipeddi told IANS.

Applying scientific methods to farming and living sustainably, Akkipeddi, along with the villagers, has in four years transformed the barren piece of land into an inspiring model that is self-reliant, environmentally sustainable and socially cohesive.

""We want to be in the place where knowledge resides,"" said Akkipeddi. As part of developing the village, ProtoVillage's inhabitants had initially built eight farm ponds in low-lying areas to store rain water and had networked them.

""Though rains are scarce in the region, one good spell of about 90 minutes one day filled the ponds with enough water to last for months and attracted hundreds of people from nearby villages,"" said Akkipeddi.

When local authorities had pushed farmers to dig ponds, they couldn't see the merit in them. But when they witnessed how we managed to conserve rain water, the number of requests to the administration to build farm ponds shot up, he noted, adding, ""Such is the power of demonstration.""

ProtoVillage is unique in other ways as well. Food is cooked for all the families in a community kitchen by both men and women, irrespective of caste and creed. And they live as a joint family, with even men taking care of children.

""In other villages, women are confined to their homes, cooking and rearing children. Here, I have freedom to learn and do a lot of things, as others take care of my child,"" Lakshmi, 28, who migrated to ProtoVillage, told IANS.

The daily chores of the dwellers include working in the fields to grow crops, vegetables, fruits and flowers. Some are involved in carpentry, soap-making, house construction and allied activities. In the evenings, apart from indulging in folk arts like music, dance or drama, ""we all sit down to talk about the things we had learnt that day"", Akkipeddi shared.

The sense of contentment the villagers live with is infectious. The Japanese concept of ""ikigai"", which means ""a reason for being"", is a familiar philosophy among the villagers -- right from 10-year-old resident and Akkipeddi's son Rishab. The learning centre in the village is also named Ikigai.

Everyone in the village is constantly learning -- from farming methods, to building sustainable earthbag homes (bags filled with mud are used as building blocks instead of bricks, making for stronger homes), setting up wind turbines or just sitting down to learn a new language or a principle of science.

""Earlier, adults in the village who couldn't read and write were shy to learn. But no longer, as we see them interacting with their kids. There is no age or gender bias in learning,"" said Akkipeddi's wife Shobhita Kedlaya, who plans the curriculum for the village.

Not to be left behind, the children have a system of learning which goes beyond the classroom. They learn to build homes, have drafted their own constitution for the learning centre, tend animals and even know to code software. And they share their knowledge with nearby villages.

The community aims at meeting nine basic needs: Food and water, shelter, clothing, healthcare, energy, connectivity, trade, education and disaster management, all in a sustainable manner.

G. Govardhan, 22, a computer applications graduate from Tekulodu, takes greater pride in farming than doing a nine-to-five job. Inspired by the work on increasing the green cover, he mobilised people in the nearby villages to grow more trees. ""This is my world, with the greenest of trees and farms. Why would I leave this and go to a crowded city for a job?"" asked Govardhan.

ProtoVillage also houses a Rural Economic Zone (REZ), where farmers and others from the region can work on entrepreneurial ideas. ""Villagers grow poultry, rear goats and sheep, or do farming with no access to innovative work. The REZ helps them to become entrepreneurs by honing their trading skills,"" said Akkipeddi.

The village now offers fellowships to rural youths, who can study and adopt their practices back home. ""We would like to create a support system for people from across the country, who want to set up ProtoVillages in their districts,"" Akkipeddi added.

According to data available with the Tea Board of India, the average price of all tea from October till December 8 was around Rs 152-157 per kilogram. In the same period last year, it was in the range of Rs 147-153 a kg.
The price of CTC leaf tea in Sale 50 at Kolkata auction centre was Rs 154.18 per kg on December 11 as compared to Rs 151.28 per kg a year ago, while that for Orthodox was Rs 221.39 per kg as against Rs 197.22 per kg, according to data from the Calcutta Tea Traders Association (CTTA).
The price of all tea in Sale 49 on December 4 was Rs 173.83 per kg at Kolkata auction as compared to Rs 166.25 per kg a year ago, Rs 143.78 a kg at Guwahati auction as against Rs 140.21 per kg last year. At Siliguri, it was Rs 147.24 per kg, up from Rs 128.15/kg.
Shares of most tea plantation companies including McLeod Russel India, Goodricke Group and Dhunseri Tea and Industries are seeing a downward trend. Since September 14, McLeod Russel has plunged 24.9% to Rs 119.10 per share, Goodricke is down 16.4% to Rs 266.35 apiece and Dhunseri Tea and Industries has fallen 15.7% to Rs 248.
The operating margins are expected to be further hit with the cost of production going up by Rs 26-30 per kg due to interim wage hikes in Assam and West Bengal.
India produces around 1,320 million kg of tea annually, of which around 300 million kg comes from the organised sector, which expects its margin to shrink due to increase in wages and tea prices remaining flat during the quarter.
For the last few years, most tea plantation companies have been reeling under stress and many fear that the wage hike will only add to their woes unless there is a price increase.
According to Jagjeet S Kandal, managing director, Amalgamated Plantations Pvt Ltd, a Tata Group company, increase in the wages has impacted the firm and this year, the industry will be more in losses than any other year.
The decline in shipments to Iran added to the woes as the industry halted export of teas to the Gulf nation between July and October due to uncertainty, which brought down the prices of orthodox teas, Kandal said, adding that while India has been exempted from the trade sanctions on Iran resulting in prices of orthodox teas going back to the earlier level, it will still not match up for the losses the industry underwent in those three to four months.
""We don't have any more tea to sell now,"" he said. Amalgamated Plantations is expecting to incur an additional loss of Rs 45-50 crore this year.
India has been exporting teas to Iran for an average of $3-3.5 per kg.
Atul Asthana, managing director, Goodricke Group, said it is a tough year for the tea industry in North India and many companies are expected to account for losses on the back of the interim wage revision in West Bengal and Assam. He, however, said Goodricke has other lines of business and hence will not account for any losses, though its margins will also shrink compared to last year.
However, there might be some respite in the near future. J Kalyansundaram, secretary general, CTTA said prices are expected to go up as there is early winter closure in Assam and West Bengal this year.
The Tea Board sent out a directive to stop plucking of teas from December 11 in Assam, December 15 in West Bengal and December 17 in Tripura and Cachar district in Assam. The move was to curb the supply of low-quality tea in the market and tea industry experts feel this would reduce the December output by 20-25 million kg this year. The country produced 54.97 million kg of teas last December.

Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare has requested the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and the State Governments to include this as an agenda in the upcoming Gram Sabhas, especially for the one scheduled on October 2, in connection with Gandhi Jayanti. This is as part of the awareness initiatives taken up at various levels by the government and insurance companies to create awareness about the scheme and mobilise farmers to insure their crops.
This is also the first season for PMFBY with its revised operational guidelines in place.

As per the revised operational guidelines, the farmers get 72 hours to intimate individual claims against
the existing 48 hours. This can be done through any of the channels provided under the Scheme and directly on the portal of PMFBY, the ministry said.
It added that in case of grievance, the farmers can access dedicated grievance redressal authorities. Revised operational guidelines provide for appointment of District Level Grievance Redressal Officer and creation of State and District Grievance Redressal Cells for fast redressal of grievances.

More than 100 also had to go to hospital after devotees consumed portions of tomato rice blessed at the Hindu temple in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
A senior police officer said laboratory tests showed the presence of monocrotophos Ã¢ÂÂ a pesticide which attacks the nerves Ã¢ÂÂ in food and vomit samples.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are trying to find out how the food got contaminated and not ruling out foul play. We have detained a few people and are enquiring further,Ã¢ÂÂ said Chamrajnagar district police superintendent Dharmender Kumar Meena, without specifying the number of arrests.
The same pesticide was responsible for the death of 23 schoolchildren in the eastern state of Bihar in 2013, one of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs worst mass poisonings.
That was caused by cooking oil kept in a container previously used to store monocrotophos.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), swallowing just 120 milligrams of monocrotophos Ã¢ÂÂ the weight of about five grains of rice Ã¢ÂÂ can be fatal.
In a 2009 report, the UN health agency urged India to ban the pesticide, as the United States, European Union and various other Asian nations have done.
Its import is now illegal in at least 46 countries.
But India plans to continue allowing its use in non-vegetable crops because it is effective and cheaper than alternatives, said a senior government official.
Monocrotophos costs only about 50 rupees (70 US cents) a kg, while a similar patented alternative would cost as much as 20,000 rupees, said Pranjib Kumar Chakrabarty, assistant director general of the state-run Indian Council of Agricultural Research.
Ã¢ÂÂFarmers want to keep using it,Ã¢ÂÂ Chakrabarty told Reuters. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs safe as long as best practices are followed and they are not used in vegetables.Ã¢ÂÂ
Monocrotophos controls a range of pests from aphids to caterpillars, mites, moths, stem borers and locusts on crops such as cotton, rice and sugarcane. Poisoning symptoms can include sweating, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and foaming at the mouth. Ã¢ÂÂ Reuters",Deadly pesticide in temple food that killed 15 in India

The Congress on Tuesday dubbed the Modi government ""arrogant and barbaric"" over the police crackdown on protesting farmers on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border even as party President Rahul Gandhi flayed it for not accepting their loan waiver demand.
In a series of tweets, Gandhi criticised the government for what he called the brutal beating of peaceful farmers and said that ""now, farmers cannot even come to the country's capital and talk about their ordeal"".
Later, addressing a rally in Maharashtra's Wardha, the Congress President accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of waiving corporate loans of over Rs 3 lakh crore while remaining insensitive to the farmers' pleas.
""Farmers from all states, be it Maharashtra, Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, have been pleading with folded hands for loan waiver. Modi, in the last four years, waived off loans of 15-20 people to the tune of Rs 3,20,000 crore but he cannot look into the plight of the farmers,"" said Gandhi.
The Congress, at its Working Committee meeting in Wardha, also adopted a resolution strongly condemning the police crackdown on the protesting farmers who had started their march in support of their demands from Haridwar in Uttar Pradesh on September 23 to reach Delhi.
""When thousands of farmers marched for hundreds of kilometres on their demands to reach Modi government's gates on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, an arrogant and barbaric government, instead of listening to their plight and cries, rained batons on them,"" the party said in the resolution.
""Reeling under debt, the poor farmers had come to remind Modi of his promise of providing farmers a profit of 50 per cent or more over and above the cost of production and seek loan waivers.
""Skyrocketing prices of diesel and fertilisers have already broken the farmers' back and to compound their misery, the Modi government has imposed 5 per cent to 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax on agricultural goods.
""The Congress strongly condemns the baton charge and violent crackdown on the farmers,"" the party said while asserting its commitment towards working for welfare of farmers.

63,416,positive,"Introduced as a viable reforestation solution, Prosopis juliflora is causing land degradation in Africa and has put pastoralists at risk as grasslands are turning into deserts

When Kenya's agriculture ministry introduced Prosopis julifloraÃ¢ÂÂa thorny weed native to South AmericaÃ¢ÂÂto arrest soil erosion in Baringo County in the Rift Valley, 30 years ago, it was viewed as a viable solution. However, this particular step to combat land degradation backfired with fatal consequences for the local populace and livestock. The noxious weed spread quickly, displaced native flora and destroyed biodiversity. It formed impenetrable thickets, blocking peopleÃ¢ÂÂs access to fresh waterbodies.

The Ã¢ÂÂirresponsibleÃ¢ÂÂ act enraged the pastoral Ilchamus community, which sued the Kenyan government in 2006 and sought compensation for innumerable damages: loss of rich pasture lands, destruction of water sources and damage to livestock. Though the court ordered the government to clear the weed, nothing was done to contain its spread. The community was not compensated either. The weed is still expanding, forcing herders to abandon their lands. There have been other cases also related to the weed, but nothing has happened so far.

Invasive species like Prosopis juliflora, which thrive on degraded lands, were introduced in Africa as reforestation solutions, says Arne Witt, an expert on alien species, at the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International, a Nairobi-based non-profit. Even in India, it is threatening bird population in Tamil Nadu. Ã¢ÂÂInvasive alien plants reproduce faster and have few or no natural enemies. They impact the productivity of croplands and give rise to human-wildlife conflicts due to gradual land erosion,Ã¢ÂÂ Witt explains.

At present, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is under threat from wild sage (Lantana camara), Chromolaena odorata, a tropical flowering shrub native to the Americas and rubber vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora). These species threaten the future of pastoralism in Africa, where over 70 per cent of 500 million hectares (ha) of grazing land is facing degradation. Scientists warn that these degraded landscapes, incapable of supporting either farm animals or wildlife, will soon resemble deserts.

Restoring degraded lands

To counter these harmful species, Witt advises land restoration. One sure shot way is to ensure that only indigenous plants are used for reforestation. Land degradation is a serious issue in Africa. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the continent loses about 2.8 million ha of forests each year, and about 50 million ha are affected by degradation (see Ã¢ÂÂBroken LandscapeÃ¢ÂÂ).

To tackle this, 20 African countries have committed to restore 100 million ha of degraded forestland by 2030 under the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative.

The Great Green Wall Initiative, which is part of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, aims to halt the southward spread of the Sahara desert. This would help sequester 250 million tonnes of carbon, create millions of jobs in rural areas and benefit more than 232 million people in the Sahel region of Africa. Under this, some 8,000 km-stretch of land will be restored from Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east. Founded in 2007 by 21 countries, the initiative has restored about 15 per cent of land till now.

But while these are commendable efforts, the reality is that more eco-systems are being lost each year, says RwandaÃ¢ÂÂs Lands and Forestry Minister Francine Tumushime. Ã¢ÂÂLand restoration in Africa is a huge challenge, but a holistic approach using land and forestry governance tools would help accelerate the process,Ã¢ÂÂ Tumushime says.

In Rwanda, a small country in East Africa, reclamation of 13 million ha of land has started. Women have been made a crucial part as they own 24 per cent of land. In Malawi, about 80 per cent of agricultural land is degraded. According to Tangu Tumeo, a senior forest officer at MalawiÃ¢ÂÂs Ministry of Natural Resources, the government has already embarked on restoring about 8 million ha through improved agricultural technologies, agroforestry and conservation of riparian lands. In KenyaÃ¢ÂÂs Mau forest area, more than 5,000 ha of forest has been restored, says KenyaÃ¢ÂÂs Environment Minister Keriako Tobiko.

Communities at stake

An estimated 2 billion ha of global land needs urgent restoration, according to Robert Nasi, the director general of the Centre for International Forestry Research, an Indonesian non-profit. The global economy loses up to US $4.5 trillion annually due to land degradation while the economic benefits of restoration amounts to $84 billion a year. Ã¢ÂÂContinued loss of forests and other vital ecosystems are affecting the well-being of an estimated 3.2 billion people globally, the most vulnerable of them are found in SSA. Degradation is a pervasive, systematic phenomenon that the world must tackle urgently,Ã¢ÂÂ he adds.

Land is an important source of livelihood for the rural poor, especially grazers. In SSA, more than 50 million herders are at risk at present due to severe land degradation. Ã¢ÂÂHowever even if commitments to restore land-scapes are turned into concrete action, strategies to halt further degradation need to be put into place to ensure that the gains already made are not wiped out,Ã¢ÂÂ Witt adds.

65,432,positive,"It is rabi sowing season in Madhya PradeshÃ¢ÂÂs Mandsaur district and Jagdish Patidar, 62, has been preparing the six hectares of farmland he and his brothers own to grow wheat, garlic, gram and mustard. On October 27, the farmer was working in his field, along with his wife and the couple of labourers he had hired, when he was told of visitors at his home in Chillod Pipliya village in Malhargarh tehsil. He jumped on his motorcycle. He found former sarpanch Ashok Patidar and some other villagers waiting in his courtyard. They had come to talk about the stateÃ¢ÂÂs Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana for the soybean crop the villagers had recently harvested.
Jagdish Patidar said he had already sold his produce since waiting for procurement under the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana would have delayed sowing. The visitors said they had done the same. The scheme, they all agreed, was a disappointment.
Across Mandsaur, Scroll.in found that farmers were angry with the Bharatiya Janata Party government for failing to arrest falling crop prices and employing Ã¢ÂÂtemporary fixesÃ¢ÂÂ such as the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana to tackle the problem. This does not bode well for the ruling party, given the Assembly election is barely a month away.
The Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana was announced by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to contain the violent protests over falling crop prices in June 2017. Amidst the protests, six Mandsaur farmers were shot dead by the police. Four of the farmers were from Malhargarh. Among them was Kanhaiyalal Patidar, Jagdish PatidarÃ¢ÂÂs younger brother. Kanhaiyalal PatidarÃ¢ÂÂs family has since left the village, making Jagdish Patidar responsible for working their land. He has now become an influential voice as MalhargarhÃ¢ÂÂs farmers have rallied against the state government as well as traders whom the farmers have accused of forming a cartel to keep the prices low.
All this seems to have fed into an anti-BJP sentiment, with many farmers Scroll.in spoke with saying it was time for change. Ã¢ÂÂIt has to be the Congress,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ashok Patidar. Ã¢ÂÂWe did a great disservice to the nation and the state by voting for the BJP in the past. My vote will go to the Congress. They will sweep this election if Jyotiraditya Scindia is named the chief ministerial candidate.Ã¢ÂÂ
Dheeraj Patidar, a BJP leader in MandsaurÃ¢ÂÂs Budha village, agreed that his party was in a difficult position. Ã¢ÂÂI will never vote for Congress, but other BJP supporters might do so,Ã¢ÂÂ said the young man who described himself as a Ã¢ÂÂhardcore supporterÃ¢ÂÂ of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs hardline ideological parent. Ã¢ÂÂI think the people are bored of this government, the chief minister and the MLAs. These faces have been around for way too long.Ã¢ÂÂ
More worryingly for the BJP, most of MandsaurÃ¢ÂÂs farmers are members of the Patidar community, which led last yearÃ¢ÂÂs protests and has traditionally bankrolled the ruling party.
Mandsaur comprises eight Assembly constituencies, all but one of which were won by the BJP in the 2013 Madhya Pradesh election. Dheeraj Patidar, the BJP leader, feared the anger would Ã¢ÂÂreverseÃ¢ÂÂ this election.

Ã¢ÂÂWho will pay us if Shivraj loses?Ã¢ÂÂ
The Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana is a complicated scheme, said Jagdish Patidar. The farmers must register on the schemeÃ¢ÂÂs website, following which state officials conduct an onsite verification of their sown area. They then get text messages informing when they must take their produce for sale at the local market. If the dayÃ¢ÂÂs average market rate is less than the Minimum Support Price fixed by the Centre, the state will pay the difference. On October 27, for example, the average sale price of soybean at the Pipliya mandi was Rs 2,900 a quintal as against the Minimum Support Price of Rs 3,399. Farmers who sold their produce that day will get a Ã¢ÂÂbonusÃ¢ÂÂ of Rs 500 per quintal. But the money would be credited into their bank accounts only later. This would leave the farmers strapped for cash just when they have to sow the rabi crops.
On top of this, the farmers complained, the scheme was only rolled out on October 20, quite late for this yearÃ¢ÂÂs soyabean crop, .
Ã¢ÂÂHad I waited till October 20 to sell, I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have been able to sow for the next season in time which would have brought down my yield,Ã¢ÂÂ said Govind Patidar, a farmer in Chillod Pipliya. Ã¢ÂÂTiming is everything in farming. Look around the village, do you see any farmer home? They are all working in the fields. That is why we sold our produce before the scheme even began.Ã¢ÂÂ
In this region, the farmers have a limited window to sow rabi crops before the soil loses the moisture from the monsoon. Missing the window would mean that farm yields would suffer.
Most of the farmers Scroll.in spoke with in Chillod Pipliya and neighbouring villages said they did not know anyone who had registered for the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana.
At the Pipliya mandi, farmers and traders said the scheme had started disastrously. The farmers who brought their produce for sale on October 20 were told they could not sell because the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana website was not working. AL Pandey, MandsaurÃ¢ÂÂs chief marketing officer who oversees the schemeÃ¢ÂÂs implementation, confirmed that the portal was down until October 23.
The farmers claimed the scheme was suspended for a while earlier this year after they protested against the traders cutting prices as well as big farmers colluding with government officials and traders to illegally claim money. Ã¢ÂÂA farmer or trader would fudge the records to show a particular piece of land was under Bhavantar,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bhagat Patidar from Rainara village. Ã¢ÂÂThey would then produce a receipt from the trader showing the crop had been sold under the scheme and take the money.Ã¢ÂÂ
Their protests have not had much effect, though, as the traders have returned to their unscrupulous ways, the farmers alleged. Ã¢ÂÂBefore Bhavantar, soybean was selling at Rs 3,200 per quintal and now the price has dropped to Rs 2,900,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bhagat. Ã¢ÂÂWhy doesnÃ¢ÂÂt the government address this? Why canÃ¢ÂÂt they cancel the licences of traders buying below MSP? Rs 500 paid under Bhavantar is good, but when will we get it? What if Shivraj loses the election? Who will pay us then? Why canÃ¢ÂÂt they give us Rs 500 at the time of the sale?Ã¢ÂÂ
According to The Indian Express, 68% of urad dal produced in Madhya Pradesh last year went for less than the Minimum Support Price, yet the farmers did not receive any compensation under the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana. Ã¢ÂÂIn the case of soybean, the stateÃ¢ÂÂs prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower Ã¢ÂÂ only 18.5%, despite its [average sale price] being 12% below MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer,Ã¢ÂÂ the daily reported. Ã¢ÂÂIn sum, [Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana] is not inclusive, covers less than 25% of the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ loss, involves too much micromanagement by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt want temporary fixesÃ¢ÂÂ
In Budha village, the farmers said they have no use for such Ã¢ÂÂtemporary fixesÃ¢ÂÂ as the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana. They need long-term measures to make farming a viable livelihood option. Ã¢ÂÂInstead of doling out Bhavantar like a favour, they should look for solutions that address the farm distress across India,Ã¢ÂÂ said Govind Patidar, a farmer.
These farmers are angry with not just their state government; they called Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢ÂÂs promise of doubling their incomes by 2022 a joke. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt even recover what we invest and he is talking about doubling our incomes,Ã¢ÂÂ said Tulsiram Patidar, a local Congress leader who works at the Pipliya mandi.
Until a few years ago, Tulsiram Patidar claimed, farming in this region was profitable, even when they grew labour-intensive crops such as cumin, isabgol, coriander. Many farmers could take loans to fund their childrenÃ¢ÂÂs education, invest in land or farming machinery or renovate their homes. Ã¢ÂÂBecause we were confident we would be able to repay the loans within the stipulated time,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Ã¢ÂÂHowever, after prices dropped drastically in the last few years, our profits dried up and our debts grew.Ã¢ÂÂ
Rising diesel and fertiliser prices have only worsened the situation. Ã¢ÂÂI am going to give farming another year,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ashok Patidar. Ã¢ÂÂIf there is still no improvement, I will give it up and migrate to some city for work.Ã¢ÂÂ
Pandey, the chief marketing officer, said the rising fertiliser prices have greatly hurt the farmers. Ã¢ÂÂThe price of DAPMPK, a fertiliser widely used in this area, has jumped from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,400 since March,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂPrices of POTAS and MPK have witnessed a steep increase as well. There is every reason for the farmers to feel distressed.Ã¢ÂÂ
In the past few years, MandsaurÃ¢ÂÂs farmers have increasingly come to see farming as an untenable option, Pandey said. Those who could afford it have been sending their children to study and work in big cities, only to now realise jobs are limited. Ã¢ÂÂI finished my civil engineering degree from Indore in May,Ã¢ÂÂ said Suraj Patidar, 24, from Budha. Ã¢ÂÂMy father took a loan of Rs 6 lakh for my education. But for six months now, I have been sitting at home, jobless. I can see my fatherÃ¢ÂÂs pain. There are so many like me. In fact, from my class, not one student is employed because no company came for campus recruitment.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂFarmers should be happyÃ¢ÂÂ
The Congress has been working to tap into this resentment and its supporters are confident of finally dethroning the BJP after 15 years. They speak glowingly of the Ã¢ÂÂhistoric responseÃ¢ÂÂ to the party chief Rahul GandhiÃ¢ÂÂs June 6 rally in Mandsaur which, they claimed, turned the tide. Ã¢ÂÂI think he broke Indira GandhiÃ¢ÂÂs record by getting such a huge crowd,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bhagat Patidar, who claimed to have been a BJP supporter until recently. Ã¢ÂÂThe rally rejuvenated the partyÃ¢ÂÂs workers in the entire Malwa region. Then, ScindiaÃ¢ÂÂs rally was also attended by thousands of people. If the Congress declares him the candidate for chief minister, it will be clean sweep.Ã¢ÂÂ
YS Sisodia, the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs sitting Mandsaur MLA, is unperturbed, insisting that talk of a Ã¢ÂÂCongress waveÃ¢ÂÂ is overblown. As for farm distress in the region, he claimed itÃ¢ÂÂs a Ã¢ÂÂnon-issueÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂWe gave compensation and jobs to the families of victims of the firing,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWho gives Rs 1 crore compensation? Congress thinks it can win on this issue but it wonÃ¢ÂÂt. Our work will speak for itself. If these farmers have so much problem with our policies, why donÃ¢ÂÂt they go and sell their produce in neighbouring states?Ã¢ÂÂ
The legislator claimed crop prices have fallen across India and the BJP should not be blamed for it.
Asked about the farming communityÃ¢ÂÂs complaint that the BJP government has failed to generate jobs for their children, a visibly agitated Sisodiya said they have laid new roads with toll booths that employ several youth.
Is manning a toll booth the most a highly educated youth can aspire to? Ã¢ÂÂAt least we are giving them something,Ã¢ÂÂ Sisodia replied. Ã¢ÂÂThey should be happy with that.Ã¢ÂÂ

66,449,positive,"NEW DELHI: IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forest cover increased by 6,778 sq km over the last two years with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana increasing their green footprint during the period though there is a worrying decline in six northeastern states, including a shrinkage of 630 sq km in the eastern Himalayas.While overall green cover, including tree patches outside recorded forest areas, reported an incremental 1% increase (8,021 sq km) over the last assessment year in 2015, the quality of forests remain a hotly debated subject even as satellite monitoring has increased availability of data.The increase, based on satellite data and subsequent Ã¢ÂÂground truthingÃ¢ÂÂ, has put the total forest cover at 7,08,273 sq km which is 21.54% of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs geographical area.Releasing the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2017 on Monday, the environment ministry looked at the overall green cover (total forest and tree cover) of 8,02,088 sq km and pitched it as a success of multiple afforestation programmes.Though this figure puts green cover at 24.39% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs geographical area, this does not reflect a complete picture as it includes tree cover of 93,815 sq km, primarily computed by notional numbers.In the past, studies have argued that the problem of depletion and over-exploitation of forests has taken a toll of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forests and their sustainability and the problem of simplifying a maze of rules and tune conservation with the needs of local communities remains a challenge.Taking into account the density (canopy covering branches and foliage formed by the crowns of trees), forest cover is divided into Ã¢ÂÂvery denseÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂmoderately denseÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂopenÃ¢ÂÂ forest. The Ã¢ÂÂvery denseÃ¢ÂÂ forest cover has increased over the last assessment of 2015, but the Ã¢ÂÂmoderately denseÃ¢ÂÂ category reported a decline Ã¢ÂÂ a sign which environmentalists consider quite worrying.Referring to decline in the Ã¢ÂÂmoderately denseÃ¢ÂÂ forest category and enhancement of forest cover in Ã¢ÂÂopenÃ¢ÂÂ forest and Ã¢ÂÂscrubÃ¢ÂÂ categories, forest expert from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Ajay Saxena said, Ã¢ÂÂThis negative correlation means that India is losing good forests for developmental pressures, forest degradation and climate change.Ã¢ÂÂSaxena termed the increase in Ã¢ÂÂvery denseÃ¢ÂÂ forest (VDF) cover as a Ã¢ÂÂpositive developmentÃ¢ÂÂ, but said a major part could be attributed to increase in the number of districts assessed in the new report compared to 2015.The ISFR updated the number of districts for its assessment from 589 to 633. The ministry, however, claimed that the change in area was calculated Ã¢ÂÂusing updated figuresÃ¢ÂÂ to facilitate comparison on a common methodological platform.Underlining that very dense forest had increased from 85,904 sq km in 2015 to 98,158 sq km, environment and forests minister Harsh Vardhan said, Ã¢ÂÂThis is very heartening as VDF absorbs maximum carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Ã¢ÂÂHe said consistent increase in forest cover over the years was in sync with IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the country would meet its target of creating additional carbon sink (2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent) through increase in forest and tree cover by 2030.The report showed that forest cover in six north-eastern states Ã¢ÂÂ Mizoram, Nagaland , Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Meghalaya and Sikkim Ã¢ÂÂ decreased in 2017. Experts believe forests in the eastern Himalayas are rich in forest carbon and decline in forest cover in the region could have been avoided. This area reported a net loss of 630 sq km of pristine forests.The ISFR 2017 shows that about 40% of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs forest cover is present in nine large contiguous patches of the size of 10,000 sq km or more. It also shows the total mangrove cover stands at 4,921 sq km and has shown an increase of 181 sq km. All the 12 mangrove states have shown a positive change in the mangrove cover, as compared to the last assessment. Mangrove ecosystem is rich in biodiversity and provides a number of ecological services.The India State of Forest Report 2017 is the 15th such report in the series. The report, however, for the first time contains information on decadal change in water bodies in forest during 2005-2015, forest fire, production of timber from outside forest, state wise carbon stock in different forest types and density classes.The report notes that there was an increase of 2,647 sq km in the extent of water bodies over the decade (2005-15) with all states and Union Territories (UTs) showing an increase except Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.It shows that overall the extent of water bodies has increased from 14,509 sq km in 2005 to 17,156 sq km in 2015 with Maharashtra (432 sq km), Gujarat (428 sq km) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sq km) figuring as the top three states reporting maximum increase in areas of water bodies including lakes and wetlands.Ã¢ÂÂWe wish that in future, extent and change in forest cover vis-e-vis major river basins in the country should be assessed and reported since forest cover is a key parameter to assess the health of our riversÃ¢ÂÂ, said river and water expert, Manoj Misra, of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.Reacting on report which shows marginal increase in forest cover, Misra said, ""Increase in forest cover is a matter to rejoice unless statistical jugglery is behind the claim.""The spatial information given in the report is based on interpretation of LISS-III data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite data (Resourcesat-II) with a spatial resolution of 23.5 meters. Satellite data for the entire country was procured from NRSC for the period October, 2015 Ã¢ÂÂ February, 2016.Ã¢ÂÂThe satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing. In addition, extensive ground data collected by field parties at more than 18000 points all over the country and information from other collateral sources are also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted imageÃ¢ÂÂ, said the environment ministry after releasing the ISFR 2017.Report shows that three states - Andhra Pradesh (2141 sq km), followed by Karnataka (1101 sq km) and Kerala (1043 sq km) - have shown the maximum increase in forest cover. On the other hand, forest cover in states like Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya has decreased in 2017 as compared to 2015.Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover of 77,414 sq km in the country in terms of area, followed by Arunachal Pradesh with 66,964 sq km and Chhattisgarh (55,547 sq km). In terms of percentage of forest cover with respect to the total geographical area, Lakshadweep with (90.33%) has the highest forest cover, followed by Mizoram (86.27%) and Andaman & Nicobar Island (81.73%).","IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forest cover increases by 1%, but NE a cause for concern"

Sharelines
The financial squeeze on India's farmers is set to worsen because of record high fuel prices and surging costs of fertilisers, posing a challenge to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an election that must be held by May.
The rise in input prices could not have come at worse time for farmers, already grappling with falling domestic product prices due to rising yields and abundant harvests. Yet, the government has few easy options to respond.
Rival global producers have complained about Indian state support and falling global farm product prices undermine export prospects. Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Modi in 2014. But a fall in rural incomes risks damaging that support next year.
Thousands of farmers marched on New Delhi on Tuesday to demand better prices for their produce. Police responded with teargas and water cannon. Farmers suspended their protests after talks with officials that ran into early Wednesday morning. But their demands and those of other agriculture workers, who together make up about half India's 1.3 billion people, have not gone away.
""Although we have decided to end our protest, we still believe that the government is not serious about addressing the concerns of the farmers,"" Anil Talan, national secretary of farmers body Bhartiya Kisan Union, said after the march.Diesel prices have surged 26 per cent this year, making tilling fields, harvesting and transporting crops expensive for India's 263 million farmers who mostly use diesel tractors. Alongside rising diesel costs, prices of key fertilisers such as potash and phosphate have jumped nearly 15 and 17 per cent respectively in a year, as companies pass on the rise in global prices and the impact of the weak rupee to farmers.India, the world's second-biggest producer of staples such as rice and wheat, imports all its potash needs and relies on foreign supplies for nearly 90 percent of the phosphate it uses.""It's a double whammy for farmers who have to bear the brunt of lower crop prices and higher input costs,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst, saying this explained ""why farmers' anger has come to the fore.""Diesel demand is rising as farmers have started harvesting summer crops. After tilling, they will plant wheat and rapeseed, the main winter crops. Union official Talan said the government needed to prop up commodity prices and keep a lid on farmers' costs to support the agricultural industry, which accounts for about 16 percent of India's $2.6 trillion economy.""Because of higher diesel prices I need to spend nearly 20 per cent more on harvesting soybean but soybean prices have crashed this year,"" said Uttam Jagdale, a farmer from Pune, about 150 km (94 miles) south of Mumbai. Nilesh Sable, a cane farmer from Sangli in the western state of Maharashtra, said fertiliser prices were rising each month.Fertiliser firms say they have little choice but to pass on at least some extra costs due to a sharp fall in the rupee and a 20 per cent rise in international potash and phosphate prices. ""Still, we are not passing the entire burden to farmers,"" said an official with a state-run fertiliser company, asking not to be named in line with government policy. Greater farm efficiency is partly to blame.Mechanised farming, high-yielding seed varieties and increased use of pesticides have pushed up harvests. Output of most crops has soared to record levels each year. India's production of pulses, such as lentils and beans, surged to 24.51 million tonnes in the year to June 2018, up from 23.13 million tonnes in the previous 12 months.Imports of pulses, such as lentils from Canada, Australia and Russia, fell to 1.2 million tonnes in the financial year to March 2019, the lowest since 2000/01 and well below the 6.6 million tonnes imported in 2016/17 after back-to-back failures in the monsoon. Plentiful supplies extend to other crops.India is set to surpass Brazil as the world's top sugar producer in the 2018/19 season, but rising output has driven down local sugar prices by 15 per cent and left mills nursing losses.In bid to help the sector, the government unveiled measures last week such as transport subsidies and incentives to export at least 5 million tonnes of sugar. Brazil, Thailand, Australia and other rival producers were quick to complain.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes, have also fallen 25 per cent from last year, largely because of overproduction. Without enough refrigerated trucks, excess production cannot be stored. Domestic milk prices dived more than 25 per cent in the past year, but a global glut has made Indian exports uncompetitive.Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said India needed to find markets abroad to reduce its inventories. ""But exports will not be easy, as global prices are depressed, and there is no export parity for most commodities,"" he said. - Reuters",Deepening farm crisis in India could hurt Modi's re-election bid

71,477,positive,"Conservationists on Friday asked the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SC-NBWL) to reverse the clearance for the 1750MW Demwe Lower hydroelectric project in Arunachal Pradesh.

The projectÃ¢ÂÂs 124-metre high dam is proposed to be constructed on river Lohit jointly by Athena Energy Ventures and the Arunachal Pradesh government. The project site, greens and local activists say, is extremely close to cultural heritage site Parshuram Kund, a major Hindu pilgrimage.

Lohit is one of three rivers that meet to form the Brahmaputra in Assam downstream.

Ã¢ÂÂI am shocked to see that your committee has granted wildlife clearance to the 1750 MW Demwe Lower project based on a seriously flawed report of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII),Ã¢ÂÂ Bimal Gogoi, a conservationist based in AssamÃ¢ÂÂs Golaghat district, said in a letter to SC-NBWL chairman, Dr Harsha Vardhan, also the Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Junked by NGT

Mr Gogoi had filed an appeal in the National Green Tribunal challenging the 2010 clearance to the project by the environment ministry. He pointed out that the NGT had, in October 2017, cancelled the final forest clearance as the project site was 8.5 km from the Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary.

As director of Bombay Natural History Society and NBWL member, Asad Rahmani had, in 2014, studied the site and said the project would submerge parts of the Parshuram Kund Medicinal Plant Conservation Area that the Environment Ministry had identified for protecting Ã¢ÂÂglobally significant medicinal plantsÃ¢ÂÂ.

Environmentalists in adjoining Assam also said the project would severely impact the grasslands of Dibru Saikhowa National Park Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ home of the only population of feral horses in India Ã¢ÂÂ and riverine islands of Lohit river, which Birdlife International identified as Important Bird Area.

New survey

The NGT had sought a peer review of the project, but the ministry commissioned a short study by a WII-led team, which acknowledged downstream concerns while saying upstream submergence would not be much of an ecological issue. The team admitted the site needed to be studied over three seasons, but its survey in February this year took 20 days.

Based on the teamÃ¢ÂÂs report in May, the project was cleared at the 50th meeting of SC-NBWL whose minutes were made public on Wednesday. The minutes said that that the wildlife board has accepted the Dehradun-based WIIÃ¢ÂÂs report on the rapid ecological assessment of impacts of Lower Demwe project on wildlife.

The WII report said: Ã¢ÂÂIn the light of the history of this dam site, wherein the submergence zone has been studied and an environmental impact assessment was approved to give environmental clearance, we feel that the creation/construction of the dam per se would not be critical in undermining the biodiversity values of the region. The submergence zone of the dam is a habitat which is available elsewhere within the region and is not critical for the conservation of any known threatened, endangered or critically endangered species population. This hydroelectric project is run of the river type water which is released. Hence, the amount of river flow quanta is not likely to be altered once the dam is filled and power generation is based on an inflow-outflow regime.Ã¢ÂÂ

Hydrologists too have found flaws in the report. Ã¢ÂÂDemwe, like most mega dams in Arunachal Pradesh and elsewhere in the Northeast, is a disaster in the making. For Assam, the disaster could be worse than KeralaÃ¢ÂÂs,Ã¢ÂÂ Partha Jyoti Das, a water expert, said.","Arunachal mega dam near pilgrimage cleared, environmentalists see red"
72,506,positive,"The impact of drought on women farmers remains unregistered by the state, which considers them only in their non-farm roles in rural households and village communities. The new drought relief manual is no different as it merely provides an alibi for the state to abdicate its responsibility towards farm crises and utilises gender to reduce its intervention in agriculture by addressing only one half of the population.

Drought is never too far in a country like India, which has an inadequate irrigation system and low public investment in agriculture. About half of all the cropped area in the country is rain-fed and supports almost 40 percent of the population. In 2015-16, over 266 districts in 11 states reported drought conditions and sought relief. Given the scale of the crisis, the role of the state in saving the lives of farmers and their families across the country cannot be understated. It is necessary, therefore, to examine factors that deliberately minimise this important responsibility of the state, especially towards women farmers.

The new Manual for Drought Management by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, used for the first time this year to identify affected areas in Maharashtra, demonstrated how the assessment of severity of drought would now be more stringent and difficult to prove. In effect, instead of measures to prevent the occurrence of drought, the state appears to have taken steps to prevent identification of drought itself. Such approach has a negative multiplier effect on women farmers, habitually neglected by state and society. This view is only reinforced in the manualÃ¢ÂÂs approach to Ã¢ÂÂfixÃ¢ÂÂ women in pre-decided categories based on their social and patriarchal roles.

While using terms like Ã¢ÂÂextremely distressedÃ¢ÂÂ to describe the condition of women during drought, the manual deals with them as dependents in a household rather than the women on whom the household depends for income through their unregistered labour.

Ironically, even as the manual uses advanced technology to decide drought, it is reluctant to apply a gendered approach towards relief. Predictably, drought relief for women is seen in the framework of nutrition, health and childcare. For instance, for ascertaining drought, the manual follows four indices of rainfall, remote sensing based vegetation, crop situation and hydrological data, that necessitates coordination with about a dozen or more agencies/ministries of state and central government. The detailed parameters monitor dry spell during the crop-growing period, water availability in reservoirs, crop vigour, among others. The manual envisages to achieve this through support from organisations like ISRO, IMD, etc. Such precision and knowledge, however, have not been used to explore the impact of drought on women who work on their own farms and as farm labour.

The jargonised intent of the state is expected to balance its lack of interest in gendering relief. On page 60, the manual states that the district administration must Ã¢ÂÂstrive to provide employment to all the able-bodied adult, men and women, and there cannot be any discrimination in the provision of reliefÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ There is, however, no suggestion on how to prevent such discrimination. Without such measures, the manual merely shows stateÃ¢ÂÂs intent and not its determination to facilitate the equal right to work for women farmers.

On page 116, the manual identifies women as the Ã¢ÂÂmost affectedÃ¢ÂÂ in a drought situation and recommends that they plan Ã¢ÂÂseveral measuresÃ¢ÂÂ to Ã¢ÂÂreduce their hardshipsÃ¢ÂÂ through the equitable management of natural resources. While community-based solutions are suggested for mitigation and relief, the same are not proposed for women farmers and farm labour. Without addressing such aspects, not only income but the survival of rural households would continue to be severely distressed during drought.

Food security through self-help-groups and community kitchens during drought have been recommended to provide adequate nutrition to and ensure good health of the elderly, disabled, women and children. In reality, and irrespective of drought, within a rural household a majority of farm women take care of the elderly, the disabled and the children. Women in rural areas are expected to play this role as their duty, along with their other responsibilities of working on fields as farm labour. The manual does not recognize this factor as an additional burden on the women farmers.

On page 121, the manual states that the women bear a Ã¢ÂÂdisproportionate share of the consequences of droughtÃ¢ÂÂ and urges that a mitigation strategy should be made in consultation with self-help-groups. It states that it would be Ã¢ÂÂfruitfulÃ¢ÂÂ to initiate an Ã¢ÂÂactive dialogueÃ¢ÂÂ with the groups. Once again, the jargonized intent of the state replaces steps that should have been taken to make it necessary for such manuals to include the suggestions of women groups before their compilation. The separation of the women farmersÃ¢ÂÂ experience from such exercise appears to be based on the stateÃ¢ÂÂs assumption that the findings need not be considered in policy. The state must desist from such generalizations, which lead to lop-sided solutions towards farm crisis of all kinds.

The state cannot restrain itself to the perceptional frameworks of gender when dealing with farm crises. For instance, water is gendered; irrigation is considered male domain while drinking water is a female domain. The reality, however, is different and has not improved the stateÃ¢ÂÂs perspective. As women work on the fields alongside men, and for longer periods than men, it is women farmers who must bear the brunt of drought due to reduced rainfall or inadequate irrigation. By allocating distress in the binary of gender, the state further withdraws from solutions that it can and should provide to women farmers and farm labour.

The Indian Air Force joined the rescue operation and airlifted 10 pumps from Bhubaneswar. Its personnel have landed in Guwahati, 270 kilometres away from the 370-foot-deep illegal coal mine, they said.
Two surveyors from Kirloskar Brothers Ltd arrived at the site Thursday night from Pune and 10 pumps of the company are on the way to Shillong, East Jaintia Hills district Superintendent of Police Sylvester Nongtynger told PTI.
General Manager of North Eastern Coalfields J Bora arrived with two officers of the company in the afternoon and they were followed by a 10-member team of experts of the Coal India (CIL) to the site to begin the assessment of the situation, he said.
The illegal rat-hole coal mine is located at Lumthari village near Khliehriat, the headquarters of East Jaintia Hills district. It got flooded when water from nearby Lytein river gushed into it on December 13, trapping the 15 diggers.
Bora said CIL has mobilised eight high-powered pumps from its establishments across the country and the pumps will be transported to the site by road.
The farthest place from where a pump has been mobilised is Bilaspur in Chhatisgarh and the truck carrying it will take three to four days to arrive, Bora said.
The CIL team, he said, will conduct all necessary exercises prior to the arrival of the pumps and it will take about eight hours to complete the fitting of each pump before it can be put into operation.
""We are waiting for the initial 10 high-powered pumps. They will be brought here in the evening today,"" the SP said.
The high-powered pumps will be transported in trailers from Guwahati till about two kilometres from the accident site. From there vehicles have been requisitioned to carry them to the mine, a senior district official said.
Meanwhile, a 20-member team of the Odisha Fire Services Friday left for Shillong with equipment, including high-powered pumps, high-tech equipment and gadgets to assist the local administration in the search and rescue operation, a report from Bhubaneswar said.
Pumping of water from the mine was suspended on Saturday last as there was no visible receding of the water level in it. The district authorities had written to the state government seeking high-powered pumps as the two 25 hp pumps, which were being used, were found to be inadequate, an official of the NDRF, which is involved in the rescue operation, said.
Kirloskar Brothers had volunteered to provide equipment to drain out the water from the mine to facilitate the resumption of the halted search and rescue operation in the rat-hole coal pit.
On Friday, a group of Indian Navy divers were being taken by air from Vishakhapatnam to join operations to rescue the miners, official sources said. They said the Navy divers will join ongoing rescue operations on Saturday morning.
Three naval personnel have already reached the site of the rescue operation and a group of divers will join them in the next 12 hours, the sources said.
Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in the national capital Thursday over the coal mine issue.
Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the incident.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Thursday contradicted media reports which quoted it as saying the trapped minors were suspected dead on the basis of the foul odour the force's divers had smelt when they had gone inside the mine.
It said in a statement that the foul smell could be due to the stagnant water in the mine as pumping had been halted for more than 48 hours.
Two NDRF teams are engaged in the search and rescue operation.
Rat-hole mining involves digging of narrow tunnels, usually 3-4 feet high, for workers to enter and extract coal.

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday dismissed the Centre's decision to hike the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of wheat by Rs 105 per quintal as a cruel joke played on the beleaguered farmers of the country.
The hike was inadequate and short of the recommendations by the MS Swaminathan Commission, which needed to be implemented for any significant difference to be made to the lives of the farmers, said Amarinder Singh in a statement issued in New Delhi.
The Chief Minister pointed out that he had been personally pursuing the matter of full implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, along with Rs 100 per quintal as compensation to farmers in lieu of not burning the paddy residue.
However, the Centre had failed on both counts, clearly indicating its non-seriousness on the issue of farmer welfare and environmental pollution, he added.
.@BJP4India led central govt has again played a joke on farmers with Rs 105 per quintal Wheat MSP hike. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve also failed to announce Rs 100 per quintal in lieu of paddy burning. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not serious about farmers. Need in toto implementation of Swaminathan Commission report. Capt.Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) October 3, 2018
The Punjab CM further pointed out that the farming community across the country had also been fighting for the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, in totality, to ensure better returns for them.
Amarinder Singh said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government had, in the past over four years, failed to take any positive steps for the farmers, or for any other section of the society. The government had promised to double farmers' income, but the promise remains unfulfilled even as its tenure is coming to an end, he added.

Bulandshahr, UP: Police arrested four people on Tuesday and were hunting for a Bajrang Dal activist in connection with mob violence here that left an inspector and a passer-by dead, as angry families demanded action amid criticism of the UP chief minister and suggestions of conspiracies.
Tears rolled down the eyes of family, friends and colleagues of slain Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh when the body was consigned to flames in a state funeral in the evening.
After initial protests, the family of the other victim, 20-year-old Sumit Kumar, agreed to conduct his last rites.
Sumit Kumar was also named as one of the accused in the FIR registered early Tuesday morning. The local residents wanted his name struck from there.
A mob of some 400 people, including right-wing activists, fought pitched battles with police on Monday in Siana area of Bulandshahr district, apparently after right-wing activists were angered by the discovery of cow carcasses strewn in a nearby jungle.
They set fire to dozens of vehicles, hurled stones and also fired at police who retaliated with gunfire.
In the violence, Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, the station house officer of Siana, and Sumit Kumar were killed.
A video emerged Tuesday showing a young man with his hand over a bleeding wound near the abdomen, being helped by other people as they all run. Someone is heard saying the man has been shot.
It was not clear if the man is Sumit Kumar.
The National Human Rights Commission issued notices to the state government and the director general of police over the incident, officials said.
Police said Tuesday four persons were arrested, but the main suspect, Bajrang Dal district convenor Yogesh Raj, was on the run.
They said 27 people have been named in the FIR while cases have been lodged against 50-60 unidentified people.
Of the 27, at least four are workers and functionaries of right-wing organisations such as Bajrang Dal, the officials said.
There was heavy deployment of security forces in the area and tension spiralled as angry families demanded justice for their kin.
There was confusion about the number of those arrested with police officials first saying four, then three and finally four again.
Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Anand Kumar told reporters that six police teams were working on the case and trying to identify the accused by monitoring video footage.
""Tension has eased in strife-torn Bulandshahr and efforts are on to ensure there is no trouble in future,"" he said in Lucknow.
Though both Singh and Sumit died of gunshot injuries, the inspector, who was posted at the Siana Police Station, also received injuries from hard and blunt objects, Kumar said.
As police continued their investigations, emotions ran high with the families preparing for the last rites.
The dead policeman's son Abhishek said his father wanted him to be a good citizen who doesn't incite violence in the name of religion.
""My father has lost his life in this Hindu-Muslim dispute. Whose father is next?"" he asked tearfully.
Abhishek said he last spoke to his father when he phoned him to inquire whether he had studied and eaten.
Demanding ""martyr"" status for the slain inspector, who was one of those who initially probed the 2015 lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq, his sister alleged his killing was a conspiracy of the police.
""My brother was killed in a police conspiracy as he was probing a cow slaughter case. He should be given martyr status and a memorial should be constructed in his name in our native place,"" Sunita Singh told reporters.
""The cow is our mother, I accept it. My brother has given his life for her. The CM used to chant 'gau. gau. gau'. Why can't he come for 'gau raksha',"" an emotional Sunita Singh asked, hitting out at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
In Chingrawathi village, Sumit's family initially refused to conduct his last rites until the government assured Rs5 million compensation, pension to his parents and a police job to his kin.
They agreed to cremate him after the district administration announced a compensation of Rs500,000.
Bulandshahr MP Bhola Singh and local MLA Devendra Lodhi, both from the BJP, visited Sumit's family in Chingrawathi.
The BJP legislator said locals from the two villages of Mahaw and Chingrawathi had found the carcass of a cow and reported the matter to the police on Monday morning.
""Police should have registered the case, filed an FIR and taken action accordingly,"" Lodhi told PTI.
Congress leader Manish Tewari described the incident as ""very sad and condemnable"", and claimed attempts were being made to instigate communal violence ahead of the polls.
While the Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati blamed the ""irresponsible and wrong"" policies of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh for the mob violence, the CPI(M) said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's ""communally provocative speeches"" were responsible.
AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi alleged that those fuelling violence in the name of the cow had been receiving full protection from the BJP and the RSS.",Four held for Bulandshahr violence

Tens of thousands of Indian farmers have marched to the parliament in the capital, Delhi, to highlight the deepening agrarian crisis.They arrived on Thursday from across the country and held a rally demanding better crop prices, drought relief and loan waivers.Indian agriculture has been blighted by a depleting water table and declining productivity for decades.Farmers make up important voting bloc in the country and, analysts say, given the scale of the protests, their discontentment could hurt the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in next year's general election.""We voted for the BJP but anti-farmer policies of the government have hit us hard,"" Lakhan Pal Singh, one of the farmers participating in the march, told Reuters news agency.One of their chief demands is a special parliamentary session to discuss solutions to the agrarian crisis, including a full loan waiver and higher crop prices.In most states, governments have been less than swift in paying the farmers more for their crops - the federal government sets the price for produce and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support.Several young doctors and medical students have also joined the farmers to show support and to provide them with medical aid, if necessary.""I wanted to be a part of this march to show solidarity with the agitating farmers.""The protest in Delhi is the latest by farmers in recent years.

77,547,positive,"A few kilometres north of the Indian border in Kapilvastu district Ã¢ÂÂthe birth place of Buddha Ã¢ÂÂ lies Jagdishpur lake, the largest reservoir in Nepal, and one of the ten wetlands in the country listed under the Ramsar Convention. The lake is home to about 23,000 birds according to the latest surveyÃ¢ÂÂprobably the largest single avian population in the country.

Local farmer Purnabashi Chaudhary often visits the lake to collect medicinal plants. When we reached the lake in the early afternoon on the first week of February, Chaudhary was resting in the shade of a tree after applying the juice of the Madaar plant to his teeth. Ã¢ÂÂIt relieves pain,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, pointing to a shrub nearby. Ã¢ÂÂBut over grazing of goats has left very few plants around the lake now.Ã¢ÂÂ

In the early 1970s the reservoir was built to irrigate adjoining paddy fields and later expanded to 225 hectares. This became one of the best habitats for endemic and migratory birds. However, locals were not aware of its importance until recently. Ã¢ÂÂPeople used to think that these birds come every year so whatÃ¢ÂÂs wrong with killing them for meat,Ã¢ÂÂ added Khan.

This all changed when the local communities came together to control such activities a few years back. But the poaching hasnÃ¢ÂÂt stopped completely. Ã¢ÂÂSome people still kill birds. If asked not to then they threaten us and say [the birds] are public property,Ã¢ÂÂ Chaudhary said.

Weighty wetlands

According to the Ramsar Convention, 2,293 lakes are listed as wetlands of international importance globally, covering 230 million hectares. Listed as the richest ecosystems on earth after tropical rainforests, these wetlands support wild animals and plants, some of which are on the brink of extinction. Jagdishpur hosts not only water fowl but one horned rhinos and royal Bengal tigers also use these wetlands as source of water.

Undervalued and ignored

Government officials agree that there hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been enough done to protect wetlands and it is low priority on their agenda. Ã¢ÂÂWith increasing population pressure, land degradation, haphazard road construction and unplanned urbanization, there is tremendous pressure on wetlands and we should be more serious about protecting these water bodies which are often termed as the earthÃ¢ÂÂs kidneys,Ã¢ÂÂ said Maheshwar Dhakal, joint secretary at the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Nepal government. Ã¢ÂÂWith the federal system in place now, we hope that wetlands will receive more attention in future,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

Nepal promulgated a new constitution in 2015 and decided to establish a federal system, abolishing the monarchy. Under the new constitution, federal governments are now responsible for managing wetlands. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not about who has been given authority, itÃ¢ÂÂs about where this falls on their priority list. Wetlands have been thought of as wastelands despite of their significant role in ecosystems and encroached or destroyed,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hem Sagar Baral, Country Manager at Zoological Society of LondonÃ¢ÂÂs Nepal office and a noted ornithologist in the country.

Ã¢ÂÂMy first visit to Nepal was in 1978. I will forever remember the remarkable diversity of bird life that greeted us in the Sal forests of the Terai Ã¢ÂÂ the feeding parties, seemingly in a hurry, packed full of woodpeckers, drongos, flycatchers, and warblers. Bird after bird was new for me and I was in heaven,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Richard Grimmett, who now heads Bird Life InternationalÃ¢ÂÂs global conservation program, in a book titled, Status of NepalÃ¢ÂÂs birds: The National Rest List series.

But in last 40 years things have changed a lot. Ã¢ÂÂAbout 20% of NepalÃ¢ÂÂs 878 birds are threatened with extinction, including 37 species which are threatened on a global scale, according to the latest research by Bird Life International and the Zoological Society of London. About 25% of those threatened are wetland birds.

But ornithologists have warned that the rapid degradation and deterioration of wetlands may lead to permanent extinction of several species. Comb Ducks used to be spotted frequently on Ghodaghodi, the largest lake in Kailali district, NepalÃ¢ÂÂs far western region. But the species hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been recorded in the area for the past twenty years, said Baral. Ã¢ÂÂUnlike other species, the Comb Duck wonÃ¢ÂÂt easily bounce back even if conditions are made favorable,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. The Comb Duck is listed under category II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), meaning it will soon be threatened with extinction if not protected.

There isnÃ¢ÂÂt much research being done on the impact of urbanization, habitat destruction and other developmental works on the wetlands. Since the birds fly across countries it is hard to estimate full the full impact without coordinated transboundary research, Baral said, Ã¢ÂÂBut research in Nepal suggests overall population is declining with some species already rare and threatened,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

Another ornithologist Benj Smelt, who has been doing research on birds in Ghodaghodi, said that once common species like peafowl (Mayur) have almost disappeared and called for authorities to take action before itÃ¢ÂÂs too late.

Human -wildlife conflict

Jogilal Dagaura has a contract to raise fish in a small pond on the boundary of Ghodaghodi lake owned by Ghodaghodi Forest UsersÃ¢ÂÂ Group. While his sons sell fish in the market, his job is to guard the lake and protect the fish from birds. Every few minutes he makes a loud sound to distract birds that come to feed in the pond. As we tried to talk to him, he ran to another corner of the lake as he saw some birds trying to catch fish. ItÃ¢ÂÂs his daily routine. Ã¢ÂÂWe bring fingerlings and grow in this pond and sell in the market, but itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to save them from birds,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dagaura.

Birds have become a source of conflict in villages because they eat their crops. In Ghodaghodi lake conservation is a story of happiness and sorrow. On the one hand, communities are happy to help protect the lake and birds, but on the other hand, birds have left them helpless. Ã¢ÂÂThey eat our crops, which is the only source of food for many of us, as we canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to buy food. ItÃ¢ÂÂs really hard to farm here with birds around,Ã¢ÂÂ said Deepak Shah, Chairperson of Ghodaghodi Community Forest UserÃ¢ÂÂs Group.

People have been demanding compensation for years, but the government has turned a deaf ear. Ã¢ÂÂWho listens to us? A compensation policy would have been very helpful as it would encourage local communities to engage with conservation of lakes and birds, but authorities are not the least bothered about it,Ã¢ÂÂ added Shah.

policy to compensate people for the damage caused by wild animals but this doesnÃ¢ÂÂt include birds.

Deepak Shah thinks that the government is not serious about protecting lakes or forests and the communityÃ¢ÂÂs efforts have been undervalued. A few years ago, he said, a boy fell into Ghodaghodi lake while playing and was killed by a crocodile. Villagers dragged his body out of the crocodileÃ¢ÂÂs mouth and demanded compensation from the government for his family, but not a single penny was provided.

The district administration office said that there is no policy to compensate for such casualties. Ã¢ÂÂDespite our commitment and efforts to save the lake, the authorities have not valued our contribution and that has irked the communities. Humans have less value than animals here,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

Declining fish, worried fishermen

About 21 ethnic communities directly depend on the wetlands of Nepal and fishing is one of their major occupations. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to get fish nowadays, wetlands are shrinking or disappearing and there are too many people,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bimala Bote, a fisherwoman near Jagdishpur lake in Kapilvastu in west Nepal. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not only in Jagdishpur that fish are declining. Rupa Chaudhary in Maghi village near Ghodaghodi lake in far west had a similar experience.

Research shows that fish diversity is declining rapidly in the wetlands of Nepal, especially in the southern plains. In Ghodaghodi lake alone there has been a 50% decline in fish diversity over the last 20 years. Twenty-seven fish species were recorded in 1998, but only 13 species were found in 2017.

Fishing communities in the east are equally worried. On the Koshi riverbank we met Chandan Kumar Mukhiya, a fisherman who feeds his family of four. As fishing became more difficult he opted to take a part time job as an electrician in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs capital New Delhi. Ã¢ÂÂFish are declining and some days I have to return home empty handed. A few years ago it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt the case,Ã¢ÂÂ Mukhiya said.

Wetlands are also the major source of drinking water for wildlife, including rare or endangered species. Wildlife officials said an increasingly dry climate across the country has put wetlands under threat Ã¢ÂÂ and this will lead to shortage of water for animals to drink. Ã¢ÂÂWe have already started pumping groundwater and collecting it in the ponds for wildlife to drink in western Nepal, but increasing dryness may lead to similar conditions in central and eastern Nepal,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bed Kumar Dhakal, chief warden at Chitwan National Park. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt have long-term data to help us understand the pattern of change in our wetlands. I think is very important to invest in this so we can make better plans before itÃ¢ÂÂs too late,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. According to NepalÃ¢ÂÂs Water and Energy Commission Secretariat report, the annual average precipitation over Nepal is decreasing at the rate of 9.8 mm per decade.

Wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet but the richest in biodiversity. Ã¢ÂÂThe first thing is to make everyone understand that these are not wastelands and they have a huge role in providing food, water, medicine and many other services as well as maintain ecosystems,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hem Sagar Baral.

As the most undervalued natural resources in the country they fall prey to any development work, but they need more respect. Ã¢ÂÂOur thinking in Nepal needs to change,Ã¢ÂÂ said Maheshwar Dhakal, joint secretary at the ministry of environment and forests.

Ã¢ÂÂFor us water means rivers flowing from north to south and we hardly consider the small ponds, lakes or marshy lands that provide such an important resource to people. They deserve better respect and better management.Ã¢ÂÂ

Most of the communities we met have plans to attract more tourists and build infrastructure around or inside lake to earn money. Ã¢ÂÂWe would like to get boats for tourists and generate income, hopefully we will be doing this by the end of this year,Ã¢ÂÂ said, Chandan Kumar Bhagat, manager of Barju lake in eastern NepalÃ¢ÂÂs Sunsari district. Locals around Jadishpur had similar plans.

Conservationists worry tourist activities will damage the habitat of the large number of birds and animals that depend on wetlands.

However, locals say that itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to maintain the lake without funding and promoting tourism will allow them to raise money to protect the wetlands. Ã¢ÂÂIf there is no benefit for locals in terms of money through tourism then who would be interested in saving these lakes,Ã¢ÂÂ Bhagat said.

Ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral believes the local area can attract more environmentally aware tourists. Ã¢ÂÂPeople go with loudspeakers, dance, and drink and there is no regulatory body to monitor. Such kinds of activities have negative impacts on birds or degrade habitat. There could be different way to enjoy in these wetlands,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWe can promote bird watching groups, where people enjoy nature rather than boats. Quality tourism rather than quantity would save biodiversity as well as increase income of communities around,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

Chaos prevailed at the border Tuesday as thousands of protesting farmers attempted to enter the national capital, prompting the police to resort to water cannons and tear-gas shells to disperse them, drawing sharp criticism from various quarters.
The AIKS said the farmers of the country are under attack from the Centre and various BJP-led state governments.
The so-called commitment to Mahatma Gandhi's ideals by the Modi government is ""mere lip service and unnecessary breast beating, and shedding of crocodile tears,"" AIKS general secretary and Left leader Atul Kumar Anjaan said.
""Once again the farmers, who were coming to Delhi on Gandhi Jayanti in a peaceful manner to put-forth their demands were subjected to barbaric police attack,"" he said condemning the police action.
Anjaan, who represented the Indian Farmers in the Swaminathan Commission strongly condemned the ""unwanted lathicharge and repression"" on the farmers on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.
He asserted that the Modi government, which claims that they are following Gandhian principles, has shown disrespect to the father of the nation by targeting the peaceful farmers and not meeting their just demands on Gandhi Jayanti.
Following the clashes, Home Minister Rajnath Singh held deliberations with Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and a few others on the farmers' issue.
Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, after the meeting, met the protesters to assure them that their demands would be looked into.
The AIKS leader said the so-called acceptance of the farmers' demands such as to implement the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations and complete loan waiver schemes by Rajnath Singh was a ""hoax"".
The prime minister and the agriculture minister during the last four and a half years have accepted these demands seven times but these have never seen the light of the day, he claimed.
""The ruthless behaviour of the Modi government with the farmers' movement is a challenge to the farming community.
""The time has come for all farmers' movement to come together and jointly fight to rebuff the anti-kisan policies of the Modi government, which is ruining Indian agriculture, farmers' families, rural India and forcing farmers for ever-growing suicides,"" Anjaan said.
Seeking to convince the farmers to move back from their protest, the government announced that a committee of chief ministers will look into their demands, but the protesters stayed put saying they were not ""satisfied"" with the assurance.

79,557,positive,"Pune: While the rest of the country is busy preparing for Diwali, for farmers in Marathwada region of Maharashtra, the festival of lights is alrady a low-key affair with lack of jobs at farms and construction sites, and drought adding to their despair after a low-yield Kharif season. Some say, just being able to afford two meals a day and water to drink would be Diwali for them.
Ã¢ÂÂGenerally we celebrate Diwali for 15 days though the festival is of five days. Shopping for grocery to make sweets, new clothes, firecrackers is done 10-15 days in advance. But this year, the thought of shopping for the biggest Hindu festival hasn't even crossed minds of people,"" said Bhagwat Burgae, 30 year-old farmer from Mahmdapur Patoda village in Ambejogai taluka of Beed district.
""The yield of crops during the Kharif season has been lesser than the investment and Rabi is out of question due to lack of water,"" he adds.
Earlier this week, the Maharashtra government declared 151 tehsils in the state of Maharashtra as drought hit. Marathwada, north Maharashtra and parts of Vidarbha and west Maharashtra are some of the regions facing a drought-like situation this year. Beed is one of the eight districts of Marathwada region that received only 63 percent rainfall and water level in dams have reached below 20 percent.
Bhagwat has ten acres farm in which he cultivated soybean, a cash crop, along with a few pulses.
He said, Ã¢ÂÂI had spent over Rs 7,500 per acre for sowing, tilling, fertiliser and pesticides, and labour charges. I would have produced at least Rs 25,000 per acre if rain was good. But this year I could get hardly Rs 6,000 per acre thus I am in loss.""
Bhagwat informs that he sowed as rain started on time. The crops also grew well till July second week, but the rain disappeared when soon after crops bloomed, causing flowers to fall prematurely. ""Both quality and quantity of crops went down and we couldn't earn,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.
This is the story of all farmers in this area. As there is no water in the wells, borewells or in the dams, people couldn't even think of opting for Rabi season, thus there is no option of any labour work till next monsoon either.
A group of women from Malvati village were sitting at a temple discussing the problems they have been facing due to lack of labour work in farms. If the drought hadn't hit the region, they would have been working at a farm since November and December are peak months for Rabi crops.
""What Diwali are you talking about? We are not able to earn as there is no work in farms. Construction sites are also closed due to unavailability of water. If I manage to just get food and water to drink every day, that will be Diwali for me,"" says Kashubai Bhande, a farm labourer from Malvati.
Currently, Bhande carries water on her head from a tank in the village.
The situation is equally bleak in Sakharpangavi village, which is hardly five kilometres away from Latur city. Some men were sitting outside a temple while others were gathered in front of a public distribution shop. Women from the village were seen arguing and waiting near a water tank of the village in the afternoon.
Satyabhama Sunate, an elderly lady from Sakharpangavi village said that by this time that is four days before Diwali, all houses would be lit up with lanterns. ""You would find colourful Rangolis in front of the houses. Women would be preparing traditional delicacies like chiwda, laddus and so on. And the kids would be playing in new clothes and bursting firecrackers. But this year, everybody is sitting idly with questions, including, how they are going to live in the coming months,"" she says.
""It is okay if we don't celebrate Diwali but after December life would be horrible. We are afraid to imagine that,Ã¢ÂÂ she adds.
Kavita Shinde, another elderly lady from Vadval, Latur, said that there is no work at farms or at construction sites in Latur. ""How can we celebrate Diwali without money?Ã¢ÂÂ she asks.
Shivaji Mamdage, a farmer, complains how farmers have lost the fervour for festivals.
Ã¢ÂÂFestivals are only meant for government servants, traders and politicians. Nobody thinks of us as part of the society. You can see celebration have begun in Latur. Sweet shops are full of customers. All houses are lit up with lanterns. But we and our kids have to worry about how to survive this drought. And we don't have any expectations that anybody will come for us,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.
The condition of farm labourers is worst as they neither do they have any stock of grains stored last year nor from this year. Their lives run on daily wages.
Appa Pisal, a 70-year-old farm labourer from Mamdapur said complains about lack of work for labourers like him. But that's not the only challenge he is facing.
""I went to the ration shop to buy my monthly grain yesterday. ""The shopkeeper told me that since my Aadhaar is not linked with the ration card, I will not get grains during Diwali. Earlier, the government would sell sugar and oil for the poor to celebrate festivals. Now, I will not get food till my problem of Aadhaar and ration card is sorted out.Ã¢ÂÂ
Burgae said that by now some of the youth would have setup small stalls selling Diyas, rangoli, flowers and decor items for houses. Firecracker shop would have also been set up. And one could see the kids playing around these shops. But this year, Diwali is turning into a nightmare for farmers in the region. ""We cannot see that the kids are unable to celebrate Diwali, eat sweets for fortnight and burst firecrackers. They are the one for whom we earn,"" he said.","'Two meals a day and water will be our Diwali,' say Marathwada farmers as drought turns festival of lights into low-key affair"

This is the situation that faces the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as it heads into its last full budget before general elections in 2019, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a doubling of farm incomes by 2022.

The agriculture sector will not just watch how much money is set aside in the 2018-19 budget but also how it is used, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also tries to woo disaffected farmers before upcoming assembly elections in eight statesÃ¢ÂÂKarnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura.

Agriculture is the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂtop priorityÃ¢ÂÂ, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on January 15, 2018, admitting that Ã¢ÂÂfarmers were not getting the right price for their produceÃ¢ÂÂ. That is an acknowledgment that record harvests and government spending are not significantly improving IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs agricultural crisis.

Fewer Indians farm, record harvests, but falling income

India has seen a decline in the proportion of Ã¢ÂÂcultivatorsÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂas the census calls farmers who own or rent landÃ¢ÂÂfrom 50% in 1951 to 24% in 2011, as IndiaSpend reported on August 8, 2014. Yet, nearly half of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs population, or about 600 million people, still depend on agriculture.

India harvested a record 276 million tonnesÃ¢ÂÂall-time highs were reported for rice, wheat, pulses, tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram) and coarse cerealsÃ¢ÂÂ4.01% higher than the previous record in 2013-14, according to the fourth advance estimates for the rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon) crops for 2016-17.

Similarly, horticulture output was a record, nearly 300 million tonnes, or 4.8% more than 2015-16, with potatoesÃ¢ÂÂnow experiencing a glut, leading to unrest among potato farmers in Uttar PradeshÃ¢ÂÂrecording a 11% increase over the previous year.

Over a decade ending 2014-15, IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs agriculture sector grew at 4% per annum compared to 2.6% per annum the previous decade, according to the 2017 Dalwai Committee report that explored how farm incomes could be doubled, as Prime Minister Modi promised in 2016Ã¢ÂÂand IndiaSpend reported on March 30, 2016, as being unlikely.

The slowdown could be witnessed in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs agricultural exports, which dipped to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, after growing more than five times over a decade ending 2014, while agricultural imports grew five times over the decade to 2015-16, Down To Earth reported on January 11, 2018.

An agricultural slowdown has evident political implications: 49% of landowning farmers voted for the BJP in 2014, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. A reminder came in December 2017 from Gujarat, where the BJP won by the narrowest margin in 22 years, winning fewer rural seats (43) than the Congress (62).

Further evidence of farm distress is evident in rising agricultural loan defaults, loan waivers by state governments and farm suicides.

Defaults, distress and suicides

Alongside record foodgrain and horticultural output in 2016-17, many Indian states were swept by farm agitations demanding higher prices for their produce from government and farm-loans waivers.

One example is tur dal. After the monsoon of 2017, imports and a record harvest caused a glut that led to a fall in minimum support price (MSP)Ã¢ÂÂthe price at which the government purchases crops from farmersÃ¢ÂÂleading to unrest and stress in rural Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat, IndiaSpend reported on June 8, 2017.

A similar glut in potatoes crashed prices in Uttar Pradesh (UP), prompting farmers to dump produce on roads statewide, the Hindu reported on January 13, 2018.

Such situations spur agrarian unrest. India witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in agrarian riots between 2014 and 2016, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. In July 2017, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest seeking farm-loan waivers and higher produce prices, the Hindustan Times reported on July 17, 2017.

As distress grew, so did farmer suicides, which increased 42% in 2015 over the previous year, IndiaSpend reported on January 2, 2017.

Indebtedness was a major reason for farmer suicides.

Nearly four in ten of 8,007 Indian farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were in debt, compared to two in ten in 2014; more rural households went into debt over 11 years; and the average rural household had borrowed Rs 1.03 lakh, according to a January 2018 IndiaSpend analysis of government data.

The fault lines of the farm crisis are sending tremors far beyond the immediate community itself. Potters, leather workers, carpenters & numerous other non-farm groups are hit by the crisis of agriculture that is driving the farmers' suicides in the state. https://t.co/ak61Oaz7BO Ã¢ÂÂ The People's Archive (@PARInetwork) January 24, 2018

Nearly 70% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on average each month, IndiaSpend reported on June 21, 2017.

In 2017, with farmers in eight states demanding loan waivers, IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs potential cumulative loan waiver was Rs 3.1 lakh crore ($49.1 billion), or 2.6% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016-17, almost equal to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs defence budget of Rs 3.6 lakh crore ($53.5 billion) for 2017-18.

The loan write-offs caused non-performing assets (NPA)Ã¢ÂÂor bad debtsÃ¢ÂÂrelated to agriculture to increase three-fold over three years to 2012-13, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the government.

A major reason for persistent farm distress and the debt-and-death cycle is that 52% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs farms depend on increasingly erratic monsoon rains.

Despite Ã¢ÂÂnormalÃ¢ÂÂ monsoon, eight states drought-affected

Although 2017 was classified as a Ã¢ÂÂnormalÃ¢ÂÂ monsoon, eight states were declared drought-affected, the Economic Times reported on April 6, 2017, revealing the vulnerability of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs farms to uncertain rainfall in an era of climate change.

Despite spending Rs 3.51 lakh croreÃ¢ÂÂequivalent to the farm-loan waivers demanded in 2017Ã¢ÂÂover 67 years, no more than 48% of nearly 201 million hectares of farmland is irrigated.

The government intended to invest about Rs 50,000 crore over five years to 2019-20 through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai YojanaÃ¢ÂÂthe Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs Irrigation ProgrammeÃ¢ÂÂto reach its target of water for every farm.

But the programme was modified to revive 99 moribund small and medium irrigation projects in 2016-17, Down to Earth reported on January 19, 2018.

As production rises, so will the demand for water for irrigation, estimated to grow from 910 billion cubic meter in 2015 to 1,072 billion cubic meter in 2050. Irrigation requires more water than drinking water, industry and energy needs. Over a decade to 2011, water available per capita fell 15%, IndiaSpend reported on August 2, 2017.

Without a long-term budgetary plan, planning for sustainable groundwater management and what is called Ã¢ÂÂconjunctive useÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂusing ground and surface waterÃ¢ÂÂIndia will face a water shortage.

As the water crisis grows, programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)Ã¢ÂÂPrime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs Crop Insurance ProgrammeÃ¢ÂÂstarted in 2016 to insure farmers and provide financial support after natural calamities, pest or disease outbreaks, could be redundant.

As excessive extraction of groundwater makes water scarce for agriculture, it may be outside the ambit of schemes like PMFBY to provide farmers insurance against crop failure.

There is a need to ensure that farm production is linked to various markets for farmers to recover full value of the quantity produced. This will incentivise the farmer to adopt improved farm technology and management practices for higher productivity, according to the Dalwai Committee report. This requires better storage and warehousing facilities.

Better storage will reduce foodgrain wastage

About 60,000 tonnes of foodgrain was wasted between 2011-16 in warehouses run by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI). This means the grain either rots or is eaten by rodents and other animals.

FCI stocks classified as damaged dropped from 18,847 tonnes to 8,776 tonnes over two years to 2016-17, according to this August 8, 2017, government response to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. That is still 731 truckloadsÃ¢ÂÂusing a 12-tonne truckÃ¢ÂÂof wasted foodgrain every year.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs cold-storage capacity for fruits and vegetables increased by 8% to 346 lakh metric tonnes over three years to 2017. This should allow farmers to reduce time to market and ensure better quality.

82,567,positive,"Walayar: A tusker, leader of a herd of wild elephants that have made it a habit to roam populated areas, was hit by a train and killed while trying to cross a track near the Walayar forest area. The elephant, which was called Jagannathan, was crossing the B Line railway track at around 5.20am Saturday when the Mangaluru-Chennai train struck it. Jagannadhan was thrown off to a distance of 15 metres.
Forest officials said it was thrown off to the Vilikket area opposite to the Velancheri Mala. The animal had destroyed cultivation in Puthussery and surrounding areas on Saturday, and was withdrawing from there into the woods when it was hit.
Jagannathan was one of three elephants which had drifted out of the Walayar-Dhoni forest and scared populated areas as they headed for Thiruvilwamala. Jagannathan, aged 25, was known as the most violent of the three.
His tusk, curved upwards, had brought Jagannathan the pet name 'Chullikomban,' or the elephant with the curved tusk. Forest officials say he was there in all three herds of elephants which roamed populated areas.
The herd used to attract other elephants into it as it roamed the villages and towns.
24 deaths in 18 years
Farmers had found the elephant lying dead in the morning. A team of forest officials arrived after they were informed. The forest department has filed a case against the Railways, citing excess speed of the express train.
The elephant was buried at the location of the accident after post-mortem. A primary report from the veterinary surgeon says the animal died because its internal organs including the intestine was smashed in the impact of the accident.
This is the 18th death of an elephant in the past 24 years along the Kanjikode-Coimbatore track.
No barricade
A proposal to set up barricades to prevent wild elephants from entering populated areas is gathering dust in some government office. The barricades were proposed from Walayar to Mundur and also alongside railway tracks in the forest areas.These areas face regular threat from the animals. Neither the Railways nor the forest department is taking any initiative.
The government had sanctioned Rs 8 crore for the first stage of the project, which could have covered six kilometres. A committee that included the divisional forest officer, wild life inspector, representatives of the Railways and panchayats was tasked with the work. A survey was undertaken, but the project just remained on paper.
The wild elephants regularly use the railway tracks in the Kanjikode-Valayar area to cross over to the populated areas. Barricades made with the iron bars of rail tracks can block them. The Wildlife Protection Society and others have appealed to the government not to give up the project, but there had been no action.
Wild tuskers have claimed two human lives in the past one-and-a half months, and two elephants have died in train hit. Yet protection measures remain a farce. Trenches were dug up and solar barricades were erected, but the result was only a waste of crores.
Distinct types
Wild elephants that scare the Valayar-Kanjikode forest area come from Coimbatore forests. They are similar in behaviour, but different in looks. The tusker with tusk pointing upwards is called Chullikomban. One that has a trauma on its foot is identified as Chappakalan, and the one with his tusk curved like a hook is named Churlikomban.
What needs to be done
Speed of trains should be regulated strictly in the Kanjikode-Valayar section, which is an elephant-protected area. Filing of cases is a routine when elephants are struck down by trains, but there had been no legal action.
Trains which run without sounding horn should face stringent legal action.
More watchmen should be appointed. As of now there are only eight in six sections.
Services on the B Line track should be trimmed. Or else a new parallel track has to be built.",Another elephant killed as train smashes it at Walayar
83,575,positive,"In 2010, heavy monsoons led to devastating floods in Pakistan that destroyed 11,000 schools. Thousands of additional schools had to be used as community shelters, preventing them from operating as classrooms. In the immediate aftermath of climate-related events such as this, damage to schools and infrastructure often interrupt a child's education.

This is even more devastating in countries and communities where access to educational resources is already strained. Following damage, repairs to schools and infrastructure tend to be slow and delayed.

Research has shown an overall reduction in educational attainment, lower academic performance, and higher rates of absenteeism among children who have experienced climate shocks.

After these events, children may also miss school due to sickness (e.g., malnutrition during drought, or increased rates of diarrheal disease after floods), injury, or displacement. In the long run, this may reduce lifetime earnings when these children reach adulthood.

A recently published Brookings brief highlights the ways that increasing girls' education can make them agents of change in the pursuit of more equitable climate action. Given the opportunity, girls can be powerful agents of changeÃ¢ÂÂand this is one area where their leadership will be sorely needed in the near future.

But while more education for girls may help make them, their families, and their communities more resilient in the face of natural disasters, the reverse is also true: these disasters are threatening gains made in girls' education.

Climate events disproportionately affect vulnerable students, particularly adolescent girls. This pattern is particularly alarming, as evidence suggests that climate-related shocks (cyclones, flash floods, wildfires) and stresses (drought, for example) are increasing in frequency and intensity.

Due to the potentially profound consequences of climate events on education, researchers and policymakers are increasingly focusing their attention on this link, and its implications.

For example, at the Population Council, we are using satellite imagery and remotely sensed data to measure climate shocks and stresses. We are linking these data with information about where people live, including those who are most vulnerable, and where education is most likely to be disrupted.

Detailed information about where climate events occur, who is at risk, and why, is essential for policymakers and school officials to take actions that minimise lost school time. These risks are particularly acute for adolescent girls, who have a short window of opportunity to get back to school before they are forced to take a different pathÃ¢ÂÂincluding marriage or migration for work.

Climate shocks such as cyclones and floods are acute and often challenging to plan for. Building maps and models identifying high-risk areas can be useful as countries and communities develop strategies for emergency response and resilience building.

Take two districts in Bangladesh where the Population Council is working to delay child marriage, which has been linked to environmental shocks and is likely to derail education for girls.

Our analyses show that 45 out of 96 secondary schools are in high flood risk areas. Using this information, schools and communities can develop action plans to prevent education disruption following climate shocks, such as running double shifts at unaffected schools temporarily.

Linking surveys from the schools and students in their catchment area with satellite imagery of flood risk can help us better understand which schools close and under what conditions. We can also learn how communities respond or adapt to challenges, the effects on educational attainment, and the risk of child marriage.

With climate-related stresses, such as drought, the effects look to be less immediate or direct when compared to shocks, but they often have significant long-term implications. Droughts destabilise the income of poorer households, many of whom are reliant on agriculture for income.

As a result, households may pull children out of school early to have them work in the formal labour market or within the household. Evidence from India, for example, shows that households in areas with high variability in agricultural production may send their daughters to get married in areas with less risk as a way to protect against household income and food shortages.

As the risk of climate events increases globally, policymakers and practitioners must integrate information about climate risks and their potential impacts with efforts to promote girls' education. National officials or international bodies may be able to identify communities at high risk of disruption by using information about communities most affected by climate events.

Additionally, short-term support for families with school-age children, especially girls, is needed and may reduce the risk of more permanent schooling disruptions.

The relationship between girls' education and climate events is complex, but work to understand the risks and best practices is growing. But for girls to lead resilience-building efforts in their families and communitiesÃ¢ÂÂboth now and in the futureÃ¢ÂÂwe must ensure that climate events do not derail their education and, therefore, their opportunities.

84,580,positive,"In recent times, runways in Indian airports have been invaded by a variety of mammals Ã¢ÂÂ ranging from hyenas and jackals at the international airport in New Delhi, to spotted deer and wild boars in Nagpur, and the common stray dog in Chennai.

But surprisingly, for a nation that prides itself on veneration of the cow, cattle have been conspicuous by their absence on runways, save for a solitary buffalo that tried to board a SpiceJet flight in Surat in November 2014. But a buffalo is not, strictly speaking, a cow, and it was finally up to the Ahmedabad airport, traditionally associated more with avian intrusions, to host a cow on its runway.

On Thursday morning, at least two flights Ã¢ÂÂ an Etihad Airways flight from Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad and a cargo plane Ã¢ÂÂ were unable to land on account of the cow, which was first spotted by the pilots.

Both flights were diverted to Mumbai and other flights were delayed.

Ã¢ÂÂIt was a stray cow that entered from the cargo terminal side. The cow was quite mad, and running around the operational area. I have asked the airport director to inquire into it and submit a report,Ã¢ÂÂ Airport Authority of India chairman Dr Guruprasad Mohapatra told The Hindu.

Inquiry ordered

Ã¢ÂÂWe have ordered an inquiry,Ã¢ÂÂ the airport director, Manoj Gangal, informed the media.

Sources said that the animal was in the airport premises for about 90 minutes before Central Industrial Security Force guards chased it out.

The incident has raised security concerns in the run-up to the high profile visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to land in Ahmedabad on January 17.

85,581,positive,"The Agriculture Ministry has approached the Finance Ministry with proposals to make provisions to punish delays in crop insurance claim payouts, and also to give incentives to those who settle them before the deadline.
Ã¢ÂÂWe want to encourage crop insurance companies and State governments that have to provide yield data, based on which crop assessments are done, to come forward to expedite the payments due to farmers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Radha Mohan Singh, Agriculture Minister .
Ã¢ÂÂAs per our proposal, whoever is causing the delay [in settling the claims] will be asked to pay the affected farmers the claim amount, together with a 12 per cent interest for the delayed period, Singh told BusinessLine.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are also toying with the idea of giving incentives to those who help hasten the process of claims settlement,Ã¢ÂÂ said Singh. But he did not elaborate on what sort of incentives would be given if the settlements are done well in advance.
Under the operational guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), launched in 2016-17, the State government is responsible for providing yield data captured through crop cutting experiments (CCEs) to insurance companies. Once the companies received the yield data, which is used for the damage assessment, the claims need to be settled within three weeks from the date of data receipt.
Delays caused
But there have been inordinate delays in settling the claims. For instance, in a written answer in Rajya Sabha last month, the government said that during kharif 2017 season, claims worth Ã¢ÂÂ¹16,448 crore were estimated and Ã¢ÂÂ¹13,768 crore approved. Of this, only claims worth Ã¢ÂÂ¹11,899 crore have been settled by the insurance companies.
The delay in settlement of claims was among the major reasons why there was a drop in the number of farmers going in for PMFBY. In 2017-18, there was a drop of 17 per cent in enrolment for the crop insurance scheme.
The Minister, however, is hopeful that these issues will be resolved with the wider use of technology in CCEs. The Ministry has already engaged as many as nine agencies, including Ahmedabad-based Space Application Centre; National Remote Sensing Centre, in Hyderabad; and private weather management companies such as Skymet and Weather Risk for carrying out pilot studies for different crops across the country.
These pilot studies were to be carried out during the current kharif season and the forthcoming rabi season, and the organisations have been given time till February next year to submit their final reports.","Impose penalties for delayed crop insurance payouts, Agriculture Ministry tells FinMin"

87,595,positive,"Opposition parties on Tuesday put the blame on the Modi government for what they described as ""brutal police action"" against thousands of farmers marching towards the national capital, with the Congress alleging that the ""Badshah of Delhi Sultanate was drunk with power"".
The parties accused the central government of being 'anti-farmer' and demanded allowing the protesters to enter Delhi to peacefully air their grievances, even as the government went into a huddle to mull over ways to convince the farmers to call off their protest.
Farmers stayed put on the Delhi-UP border in Ghaziabad and other places, where they were stopped by the police including with the use of water cannons and tear-gas shells. Some reports suggested use of lathi-charge as well.
The protest call has been given by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) over demands ranging from farm loan waiver to cut in fuel prices.
The farmers, riding tractors and trolleys, broke barricades of the UP Police and then started proceeding towards the barricades put up by the Delhi Police. Tear gas was also used to disperse the crowd, officials said.
Reacting to the development, Congress president Gandhi Tuesday accused the BJP for ""brutal beating up"" of farmers at the Delhi border on the International Day of Non-Violence and said that they cannot even air their grievances in the national capital.
""On International Day of Non-Violence, the BJP's two-year Gandhi Jayanti celebrations began with the brutal beating of farmers peacefully coming to Delhi. Now, the farmers cannot even air the grievances coming to the capital!"" he tweeted in Hindi.
The Congress Working Committee, the highest decision-making body of the party which held its meeting in Maharashtra, also adopted a resolution strongly condemning the police action against the farmers.
Condemning the police action, Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said if the Centre can write off huge debt of a few industrialists why it could not waive the loans of farmers.
Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he alleged that ""arrogance has gone to his head"".
""Instead of hearing them out, farmers are brutalised and beaten up. The Baadshah in the Delhi Sultanate is drunk with power,"" the Congress leader alleged.
Hitting out at the police action against the farmers, Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said, ""We strongly condemn this action and atrocities on farmers. This once again demonstrates the anti-farmer attitude of the Modi government.
""Modi government has backtracked on all its promises made to farmers. This anger and protest is not bothering the Modi government,"" he said.
Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav also extended his party's support to the protesting farmers and alleged the farm community has been hit hard by the rising fuel prices, as well as due to the decisions like the GST rollout and demonetisation.
""The farmers have come out in support of their various demands... If we look at things, in the past over four years, almost 50,000 farmers have committed suicide, mostly in BJP-ruled states, including Uttar Pradesh,"" Yadav said.
The Communist Party of India (CPI) also condemned the police action against the agitating farmers.
""The farmers who were on a peaceful march towards the national capital under the banner of BKU raising their genuine demands including waiver of loans were stopped by police at the border and beaten up on a day when the nation is celebrating the birth anniversary of the Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi,"" the party said in a statement.
The Left-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha also condemned the police ""brutality"" on protesting farmers and slammed the government over the issue.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that preventing a protest march of farmers from entering the national capital was ""wrong"" and pitched for allowing them entry into the city.
""Why are the farmers being stopped from entering Delhi. It is wrong. Delhi belongs to all. They should be given entry in Delhi. We support their demands,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of an event held at the Delhi assembly to mark Gandhi Jayanti.
Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashvi Yadav said that by discarding the Swaminathan committee report, the Modi government has stabbed the farmers in the back.
""Modi ji, though farmers, unlike capitalists, cannot fill your pockets, but at least don't get them beaten up. If you would have seen poverty, you would not have committed so many atrocities on farmers,"" he tweeted in Hindi.
The Delhi Police had on Monday imposed prohibitory orders in east and northeast Delhi, anticipating law and order problems as thousands of BKU members were marching from Haridwar to reach the national capital.
Seeking to convince the farmers to move back from their protest, the government announced that a committee of chief ministers will look into their demands, but the protesters stayed put saying they were not ""satisfied"" with the assurance.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh held discussions with Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and a few others to discuss the farmers' issue, after which Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat met the protesters to assure them that their demands will be looked into.

The NDRF has continued its rescue operations despite confirming that there is no possibility of anyone in the main shaft of the mine.
But the challenges are the ""water level and inadequate equipment"" for the tragedy. India Today TV travelled to the ground zero to bring you the real pictures of this tragedy.
Santosh Kumar Singh, assitant commandant of the NDRF said, ""Local administration has provided 20 horse power pumps. When we asked them to help then with their own resources they started pulling out water which did not affect much. Water was not reducing and rainfall added to increasing it. So we called some water and mine experts because pumping was on for 24 hours but water level was not receding.""
Rat-hole mining is illegal and is rampant, but it is unique to Meghalaya due to its demography and quality of coal.
Meghalaya has large deposits of coal and limestone and unscientific 'rat hole' mining of coal in the Jaintia Hills and other parts of the region. Meghalaya is one of the largest coal producing states in India, and the largest in the north-east region and the state government has earned a revenue of Rs 700-crore per year till the National Green Tribunal ban on coal mining in Meghalaya till 2014.
The NGT in April 2014 had passed an interim order banning rat-hole coal mining in Meghalaya after the All Dimasa Studen's Union and Dima Hasao District Committee filed a petition before it, which reported about the acidic discharge from coal mines of Meghalaya and polluting the Kopili River downstream.

89,602,positive,"The Western Ghats is one of 14 biodiversity hotspots in the world, stretching from the Tapti River to Kanyakumari through Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 63 rivers originate from different locations of the stretch and the lives of the people of the entire Indian peninsula are dependent on them. The area comprises of gentle to steep slopes and supports a huge biodiversity of flora and fauna.

Population growth has resulted in expansion of human areas and consequently diversion of forest lands for development projects such as roads, railway lines, transmission lines, reservoirs for irrigation and power projects, etc. Forests are also denuded and degraded due to heavy anthropogenic pressure of encroachments, grazing, forest fires, illicit cutting of trees for timber, poles and firewood, and illegal collection of non-timber forest products (NTFP) and medicinal plants.

The Forest Rights Act 2006, to safeguard the rights of scheduled tribes and other forest dwellers, was enacted with good intent, but the implementation was tardy as officers came under pressure to accept all claims. In forested districts like North Kanara, Haveri, Kodagu and Shimoga, there was aggressive clearing of forest growth. The communities had the patronage of political masters. Politicians conducted public meetings and encouraged villagers to clear more and more forests and claim title. When the cases were rejected by Deputy Commissioners, they were pressured. Forest officers were silent spectators as tree-growth clearing continued unabated. Areas, where encroachments were evicted, were reoccupied and titles were claimed. It may be time to take a relook at the Forest Rights Act.

The Karnataka (Preservation) of Trees Act was meant to regulate permissions for tree-felling on private lands in the Western Ghats. Not all wooded areas were reserved. Vast stretches, especially in Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Kodagu districts, were under the control of the Revenue Department. Kodagu district had a number of confusing land tenures; officers, politicians and timber merchants have enjoyed this confusion. Some areas were encroached and much more were allotted for coffee cultivation. Wooded areas lost their character as varieties of timber species were extracted by merchants. Coffee plantations have now a monoculture of silver oak trees. A series of reports by the French Institute of Pondicherry suggest that Kodagu district lost 30% of tree cover between 1967 and 2007. The granting of tree-felling permission on steep slopes in hilly districts is the reason for the flood and landslides that Kodagu faced recently.

The parent soil in the region is Ã¢ÂÂbanded hematite quartziteÃ¢ÂÂ (BHQ), barring patches where it is of unstable clay origin. Accordingly, soil is lateritic on the top, which is stable, as indicated by the presence of Xylia xylocarpa trees. Kodagu and vast stretches of Kerala belong to this exceptional group of clayey parent material. The absence of Xylia xylocarpa tree in Kodagu indicates that soil is relatively unstable. It is necessary in such tracts that miscellaneous tree species are not extracted, as a precaution against landslides. Unstable soil structure is the reason for failure in fixing Shiradi Ghat road.

In such a fragile ecosystem, large-scale development projects have made matters worse. When we attempt to change the landscape, we clear the tree growth, use JCBs to demolish the hillock, take up construction of tourist resorts, disturb the natural drainage pattern, make layouts in paddy fields, construct ever more roads in the ghat section, etc. The recent flood and landslide were the consequences of our actions.

In Sakleshpur taluk, forest is diverted for a number of mini-hydel projects, which hardly contribute to power generation. We have sacrificed an elephant corridor in an ecologically fragile area. The widening of roads, taking railway line to Kerala through the forests of Kodagu, reviving the Hubbali-Ankola railway line are disasters in the making. The elephant population in the Dandeli Elephant Reserve is steadily increasing. A railway project in North Kanara will fragment the forests, resulting in increased conflict with wild animals. The destruction of forests for such big projects cannot be compensated in economic terms, it has wide-ranging environmental consequences that we cannot mitigate. If we disturb the natural drainage pattern for water and clear the tree growth, what will follow are landslides, flood and droughts, which will have enormous social cost.

The decision of the Government of Karnataka to not accept the Gadgil Report must be revisited. The report proposed three types of Eco-Sensitive Zones to denote where activities are permitted, regulated or prohibited. Activities like quarrying, mining, industries, etc., were prohibited in the Ghats. Ecological issues were to be managed by Grama Sabha. Agriculture was to be practiced only in A and B class of lands. Presently, agriculture is being practiced in class C and D lands, which are to be continued. If the state accepts the report with some modification, it will save the Western Ghats by prohibiting mining, industries, etc., which are the root causes of tree-felling and alteration of landscape.

Felling of naturally growing trees in the Western Ghats should be prohibited, especially in Kodagu and Sakleshpur areas. Clearing these trees for big projects is a sure way to a future disaster. Any plans for layouts, tourism infrastructure, etc., should undergo rigorous scrutiny. Industries and mining, including removal of sand from the river beds, can have disastrous consequences on the environment and should be prohibited.

Tucked away in the North Eastern part of India, Meghalaya has successfully managed to attract many tourists, both domestic and foreign, over the past few years. But unfortunately, with the passage of time, the craze for development and industrialization at the expense of the environment has reduced some pockets of the green landscapes to a barren wasteland.

And the deforested, plain and barren lands in mineral-rich areas of Jaintia Hills, West Khasi Hills and Garo Hills serve as a perfect example of how nature has, time and again, been mercilessly exploited and ravaged in the name of development, economic transformation and revenue generation.

The ban on coal mining in Meghalaya imposed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has prevented unscientific mining (though illegal mining is still reported in some areas) from further poisoning the river bodies and exploiting the already bare and naked hills, previously subjected to massive deforestation.

But coal mining is just one part of this severe ecological destruction. Illegal production of charcoal to fuel the ever growing industries is another critical factor which contributes to environmental degradation in the state.

FERRO-SILICON FACTORY: ILLEGALITIES UNDER THE TABLES?

One such case has been unearthed in West Khasi Hills which houses the Shakambari Ferro Alloys Pvt Ltd in Rwiang village. This factory has been alleged of being responsible for the pollution of the Rwiang River and ridding many hilly areas off their trees to Ã¢ÂÂillegally produce charcoalÃ¢ÂÂ.

This factory, which was established in 2012-13 at Rwiang village, located 15 kms away from Nongstoin, the headquarters of West Khasi Hills, came under scanner after it was alleged that labourers are being brought from outside the state without adhering to the Migrant Workmen Rule and for Ã¢ÂÂviolation of environmental normsÃ¢ÂÂ.

Few days ago, a studentsÃ¢ÂÂ body Ã¢ÂÂ Hynniewtrep Youth Council (HYC) conducted an inspection at the factory site and found that many of the labourers from outside the state are without labour licence and work permit besides alleging that the factory is illegal manufacturing charcoal and releases its effluents directly into the Rwiang River, thereby polluting and reducing the number of aquatic species in the river.

Ã¢ÂÂThey (Factory) have been manufacturing charcoal illegally and this is evident from the rampant deforestation in some hillocks. What is even worse is that the pollution caused to the river bodies. According to the Forest and Environmental norms, the main ferro-silicon plant should be located more than 500 meters away from the river; however, such is not the case. The plant is located right next to the river hardly 25 meters away from the same,Ã¢ÂÂ HYC Education Secretary, Wellesley Lyngkhoi told this scribe.

WHAT WAS PROMISED DURING THE 2010 ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEARING?

According to RTI findings filed by a social activist recently (a copy of which is available with the scribe), it was informed that the environmental public hearing in respect of the proposed Ferro Silicon Plant (8940 MT per annum) along with Captive Power Plant of 10 MW at Riwiang village, Nongstoin in West Khasi Hills by M/s Shree Shakambari Ferro Alloys Pvt Ltd was held on April 28, 2010.

During the hearing, it was informed that company has acquired 11.47 hectares of land and the project would be the first big scale project in West Khasi Hills. The Company had also proposed to spend Rs 655.09 lakh on air pollution control systems with a recurring cost of Rs 80 lakh.

Furthermore, the Company had proposed to undertake plantation over an area of 3.65 acres in phases, the same of which was Ã¢ÂÂnever followed in letter and spiritÃ¢ÂÂ, said the HYC leader adding that they promised hospitals, schools and many others but sadly, nothing much of what they assured materialised.

The then headman for Peace and Development Council of WKH, SK Bani had requested the company not to use charcoal as raw material as this will lead to deforestation. But, it was alleged that much has been going on, under the carpet.

Replying to one of the publicÃ¢ÂÂ queries, the company had informed that the main ferro-silicon plant shall be located more than 500 meters away from the river. However, reports say otherwise.

Referring to the public hearing, Lyngkhoi said there were some people who were sceptical of the proposal of setting up the plant. Ã¢ÂÂHowever, these same people, who had expressed their apprehensions and who had recently issued several complaints regarding violation of environmental norms and recruitment of migrants, are now turning their back and shifting their stance. Maybe money power and false assurances have done the job,Ã¢ÂÂ said the HYC leader.

SHREE SHAKAMBARI FERRO-SILICON ALLOYS PVT LTD REACTS TO ALLEGATIONS

Amid allegations from several quarters, the Vice President of the Company, SC Mahanta clarified that the company has and is strictly abiding by the Forest and Environmental norms. As was alleged, Mahanta said that the company uses low ash metallurgical coke to run the factory and not charcoal.

Ã¢ÂÂCharcoal is only used for the furnace and the raw material is being imported from Karnataka and not produced locally. We have all the proofs to substantiate our claims,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mahanta adding that in case of labourers working without permits, majority of the labourers are locals while only a few are from Assam. Ã¢ÂÂThe labourers from outside the state are equipped with permits and licences, however, owing to the frequent renewal of the permits, the applications sometime take time to process,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

Reacting to the HYCÃ¢ÂÂs inspection conducted recently, the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs VP accused the studentsÃ¢ÂÂ members of assaulting the staffs and labourers of the company while trying to forcefully enter the factory. Ã¢ÂÂWe have informed the same to the DC, SP and even took up the matter at the minister level,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

On allegations pertaining to violation of environmental norms, Mahanta said that during the public hearing in 2010, he had mistakenly announced that the main ferro-silicon plant shall be located more than 500 meters away from the river. Ã¢ÂÂI made a mistake then; it should have been 500 ft not meters; the mistake was rectified the very next day and the same was forwarded to the pollution control board,Ã¢ÂÂ he clarified.

He also denied allegations pertaining to the release of effluents directly into the river. Ã¢ÂÂWe have pollution control systems, where the effluents are being directed to our own drainage system for re-use and there are no leakages of the same into the river, as alleged,Ã¢ÂÂ he claimed.

DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION REACTS TO COMPLAINTS: ORDERS ENQUIRY

Reliable sources informed that on July 2 this year, the West Khasi Hills district administration had ordered an enquiry into the alleged illegal manufacturing and use of charcoal by Ferro alloy Factory. The inquiry was conducted by a magistrate on July 4 and report of the same was submitted on July 8.

On July 4, the magistrate made an unannounced visit to the factory. The report stated that the factory uses charcoal and metallurgical coke for combustion. It was informed that the factory procures charcoal from states like Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland (as claimed by the company), but the report stated that the company failed to produce a stock register.

It was alleged that the company produced false receipts from other states which are un-stamped. They claimed that they had procured 10 MT of charcoal from Nagaland on June 2018 and the same was transported but the transit pass issued by the Forest Department of Nagaland was not stamped.

Further on inspection, it was found that about 50 MT of charcoal was available in the factory storage yard as on July 4. It was informed that considering the consumption of charcoal per day, the procurement made and the quantity available in stock, the report concluded that the charcoal procured by the factory is Ã¢ÂÂillegalÃ¢ÂÂ and appeared to have been purchased/manufactured locally.

Confirming this, the Deputy Commissioner of West Khasi Hills, KL Nongbri said that an enquiry has been conducted following complaints from certain quarters but the factory was inspected by the officials of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board recently. Ã¢ÂÂThere is nothing bad in the report. It appears the Company has complied with the pollution norms,Ã¢ÂÂ said Nongbri adding that the Board has recommended for a joint inspection, the same of which is welcomed and will be carried out soon.

ALSO WATCH:

Ã¯Â»Â¿

When asked whether any enquiry was done by the district administration in the past, the DC said Ã¢ÂÂIn the past, we have sent reports to the MSPCB. We conducted inspections from time to time.Ã¢ÂÂ

When confronted with the question pertaining to various reported anomalies and alleged manufacturing of charcoal leading to deforestation in some areas, the Nongbri said Ã¢ÂÂNo, as of now, we are still compiling a report to be sent to the Government. The enquiry has been conducted and we are sending the reports to the government in this regard.Ã¢ÂÂ

WHAT DOES THE AMBIENT AIR TEST REPORT OF THE MSPCB SAY?

According to the recent test report of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board, it was highlighted that while other parameters were within the prescribed limits, the Particulate Matter (PM10) was found to be above the prescribed limits of Ambient Air Quality Standards. The PM10 was found to be 130.0 as against the permissible limit which was 100.

Meanwhile, reliable sources have informed that one prominent NGO has decided to approach NGT to take punitive action against Shakambari Ferro alloys factory.

It was alleged that successive governments and officials have failed to take action against this company Ã¢ÂÂfor unknown reasonsÃ¢ÂÂ. It is alleged that the companyÃ¢ÂÂs proprietor is Ã¢ÂÂa well connected man and has been able to weather all allegations in the past.Ã¢ÂÂ

Gujarat received scanty rains at 637 mm till October 5, about 23 per cent departure from the StateÃ¢ÂÂs average rainfall of 831 mm. Alleging Gujarat government for deliberately not allocating adequate Narmada waters to farmers through canals, Sagar Rabari of GKS stated that State government prefers allocating more water for industries and urban centres than farmers.
Ã¢ÂÂCrop condition in the districts of Saurashtra and North Gujarat is very delicate. The need water urgently. But the government prioritizes watering the lawns of GIFT City, and townships around Ahmedabad,Ã¢ÂÂ said Rabari quoting an RTI reply.
The farmer leader also alleged that the government was delaying the pronouncement of drought-hit districts to benefit the insurance companies at the cost of farmers.
Ã¢ÂÂThere is a need to pronounce 21 districts as scarcity-hit and allow farmers to make insurance claims. Three districts have over 60 per cent rain deficit, while 18 districts have deficit between 20-59 per cent . There is no fresh rainfall expected which can be widespread and benefit crops,Ã¢ÂÂ Rabari stated adding that the government needs to release water in the Narmada Canals on urgent basis to save the kharif crops, mainly cotton and groundnut.

This indicates that the government is likely to shift its focus to rural development and the farm sector ahead of the next general elections, expected in 2019.

Over the last two years, the Narendra Modi government has been grappling with several manifestations of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs agrarian crisis and had to deal with several crashes of farm commodity prices, most recently when the plunge in potato prices in Uttar Pradesh earlier this month. The political fallout of this was evident in Gujarat last month where the Bharatiya Janata Party was given a scare during the Assembly elections as the Congress capitalised on the Patidar agitation, which had its roots in the regionÃ¢ÂÂs agrarian problems.

Change in format

Traditionally, the Economic Survey offered the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs assessment of how the economy had fared in the preceding 12 months by summarising how economic and fiscal trends had played out. It made some projections about how the economy would move in the short and medium term and, at times, offered prescriptive suggestions.

But this structure was changed by the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, with the survey for 2014-Ã¢ÂÂ15. Subramanian divided the document into two. The first volume explored various themes of economic development. The second volume reflected on the state of the economy in the traditional format.

The 2014-Ã¢ÂÂ15 survey made a pitch for giving cash to beneficiaries of social welfare schemes instead of material benefits. Subramanian described this as the Ã¢ÂÂJAM trinityÃ¢ÂÂ, referring to benefits that would be linked to Jan Dhan bank accounts for the poor, the Aadhaar unique identity scheme and mobile phones. In the three years since, the Modi government has moved slowly along the JAM track, although it has been careful not to convert all social welfare benefits into cash transfers.

That survey also devoted attention to the trouble banks faced from mounting bad loans as well as the slowing investment as large companies became financially unhealthy, a theme Subramanian would return to the next year. It discussed possible strategies for the Make in India programme to encourage indigenous manufacturing, and how the economy could be reinvigorated by increasing investment in the railways. A proposed for establishing a national and integrated market for farm commodities was also mooted.

In 2016-Ã¢ÂÂ17, the survey again discussed the investment and banking gridlock, but explored other important themes too. One was providing a Universal Basic Income to all citizens, another was presenting a more favourable opinion about the consequences of demonetisation, which was announced in November 2016. However, the idea of the basic income was put aside by the government rather quickly.

Reassessing priorities

What was absent in these surveys was a clear focus on agriculture, the rural economy and employment. The emphasis on these themes in the survey for 2017-Ã¢ÂÂ18 means the government is likely to shift its focus to rural development and agriculture in the remaining period of its term, which ends early next year. In fact, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recently emphasised that farmers would be the focus of the government.

The first volume of this yearÃ¢ÂÂs economic survey, like in previous years, will be a mix of policy advice and academic analysis. It might also provide economic logic for policy decisions the government is likely to announce through the Budget, such as a price support mechanism for farm commodities for which the Centre current provides a minimum support price but does not buy much of.","With eye on 2019 polls, Modi regime will focus on rural economy, agriculture"

Highlights Discovery of carcasses trigger for outbreak of mob violence Confusion surrounds the arrests of four men They were charged with slaughtering cows in Bulandshahr
Confusion surrounds the arrests of four men - all Muslims - on charges of slaughtering cows in Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh.
The discovery of the carcasses had become the trigger for an outbreak of mob violence culminating in the murder of a police officer and a student last Monday.
Shortly after the discovery of the carcasses, the police registered a First Information Report or FIR based on a complaint by Yogesh Raj, a Bajrang Dal leader.
In it, he named seven men, all from Nayabas village, 11 km from the site where the carcasses were discovered.
By Wednesday morning, the police arrested four men - two of whom were not named in the FIR.
In a separate case over the mob violence and the killing of the police officer, the police have named 27 people, and filed charges against over 50 unidentified individuals. Nine have been arrested in this case so far but accused No. 1 - who is yet to be arrested one week later - is Yogesh Raj.
One of those arrested based on Yogesh Raj's FIR was Sarfuddin, a garment trader.
Sarfuddin (left) was at a congregation 40 km away on the day of the violence, his family said.
Sarfuddin's family claimed that on the day the carcasses were discovered, he was 40 km away at an Ijtama, a three-day Muslim religious convention held on the outskirts of Bulandshahr.
""He (Sarfuddin) was at the Ijtama, he had parking duty that day,"" said Mohammad Hussain, Sarfuddin's brother, while holding out Sarfuddin's duty badge. ""I have proof that he wasn't here, one can track his GPS location and check if he ever went to Mahav,"" he added.
Sarfuddin's name came up because of history between Yogesh and him, claims his brother. ""Like he (Yogesh) is Hinduwadi, we are also Muslimwadi. We will fight for our rights,"" said Hussain.
According to Hussain, it all began when the microphone of their mosque was taken away allegedly by the right-wing outfits operating in the village. ""We end up missing the azaan when we are sleeping because we can't hear it,"" he said.
Mohammad Hussain said Yogesh Raj, of the Bajrang Dal, framed Sarfuddin.
Sarfuddin had been pulling all strings to get a new mic installed in his capacity as the head of mosque administration, but ""Yogesh never liked that"" the villagers said.
The police also arrested 26-year-old Sajid Ali, also named in the FIR.
Sajid, however, does not live in the village. His uncle Shabbir, a tea vendor said ""Sajid moved to Faridabad 12 years ago.""
He told us that Sajid has been selling cigarettes in Faridabad for years, and had visited Bulandshahr for the Ijtema but hadn't come to the village.
Sajid Ali moved to Faridabad 12 years ago, his family said.
""Last he visited me was over three months ago, when my mother passed away,"" he said. Both Sarfuddin and Sajid surrendered to the police on Tuesday.
The police also picked up two men not named in the FIR - 24-year old Asif, who repairs watches, and Banne Khan, a daily wage labourer.
Asif, like Sajid had moved away from his village in Aurangabad, 20 km away from spot of violence, four years ago and settled in Mumbai after he got married, his family said.
The police did not even know Asif's name when they came to arrest him, Najrana, his mother-in-law, said.
He had come to his village after attending the Ijtema when the police came knocking. ""The police just came, woke him up and took him away. They didn't even know his name, someone else told them it was Asif,"" said Najrana, his mother-in-law who lives with his family in Mumbai.
Banne Khan lives nearly 50 km from Bulandshahr and 65 kilometres from the spot of the violence.
Banne Khan has seven children and is the only earning member of his family, Afsar, his relative, said.
He was arrested by the police on Tuesday night. ""He had finished work at the pradhan's house and was sleeping when the police came,"" said Afsar, his relative. Khan has seven children and is the only earning member of the family.
Villagers gathered outside the kachcha two-room house of Khan. ""All this is politics, it is BJP's government, that's why (he was arrested). Look at his house, he is a poor man,"" said Ansar, his neighbour. ""He has no relatives in Siana, he may have never even been there ever,"" added Afsar. Siana is a Kasba where Mahav village is located.
Asked about the basis of these arrests, senior police officials said that Sarfuddin and Sajid had been arrested because they were named in the FIR.
But they did not clarify why Khan and Asif had been arrested in the case, despite repeated attempts for answers.

95,653,positive,"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tens of thousands of farmers marched to the Indian parliament in New Delhi on Friday, demanding that lawmakers hold a special session to discuss their most pressing issues, including a lack of land rights, mounting debt and plunging produce prices.
It was the latest of several protests this year.
Thousands of women farmers marched into Mumbai alongside their male peers in March, demanding recognition of their rights over forest and farm land.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are demanding legal rights for farmers - especially for tenant farmers and women farmers with no rights,Ã¢ÂÂ said Kavitha Kuruganti, with the advocacy group Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture.
Ã¢ÂÂOur farmers need secure rights over land and better prices for their crop to be free from debt,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.
Campaigners say implementation of the landmark 2006 Forest Rights Act (FRA), which was meant to benefit a fifth of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs population, has been hobbled by conflicting legislation and a lack of political will.
At the same time, states have diluted several protective clauses of the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 to speed up purchases for industry and infrastructure.
Since the laws are not effectively applied, farmers need Ã¢ÂÂstronger rights to their landÃ¢ÂÂ, said Namita Wahi, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi.
Ã¢ÂÂ(Farmers need) not only a title, but also use, possession, occupancy and livelihood rights,Ã¢ÂÂ she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
The rights of farmers and indigenous people have grabbed an unlikely spotlight in elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh states.
Analysts say their discontent could hurt Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢ÂÂs Hindu nationalist party in an upcoming national election.
The government points to initiatives such as improved irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms as evidence it has helped rural Indians, who make up about 70 percent of the 1.3 billion population.
But lawmakers have to do more to fix the farmer crisis, said economist Niranjan Rajadhyaksha, who called for the right to property to be reinstated in the constitution.
IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs constitution of 1950 recognized the right to property as a fundamental right. But subsequent laws undermined that right, and it was scrapped in 1978.
No major political party has since made reinstatement of the right to property a campaign issue, lest they be seen as pandering to the rich, Rajadhyaksha wrote in Mint, a daily newspaper.
Ã¢ÂÂProperty rights are a tool of inclusion rather than exclusion,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote.
Ã¢ÂÂThe poor have neither the legal resources nor the political heft to fight laws or administrative orders that allow the takeover of their land, (and) not enough opportunities to make a living in case they are forcibly separated from their property.Ã¢ÂÂ",Right to land is top demand as Indian farmers march to parliament

India's rural sector continues to be plagued by declining prices and lack of effective channels for marketing agricultural produce. To this end, a properly designed milk scheme for farmers, farmer producer organisations (FPOs) scheme for farmers to assure that the entire value chain is taken care of and, wherever possible, an agri-income support scheme need to be launched. These measures could provide a beginning in the right direction at least in the interregnum, says a research note.
In the report, State Bank of India (SBI) says, ""We believe that the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan' (PM-AASHA) procurement scheme as envisaged by Niti Aayog has not seen interest across states. Coupled with this, loan waivers in states are now becoming fashionable to address farmer distress, which has delirious consequences on bank non-performing assets (NPA), agri credit growth and public investment in agriculture. We must endeavour to create domestic and export markets for farmers. Otherwise we will land up in a vicious cycle year after year!""
During the second quarter Q2 FY18-19, agriculture and allied activities grew by 3.8% as compared to last yearÃ¢ÂÂs growth of 2.6% and Q1FY18-19 growth of 5.3%.
According to SBI, there are many ways of interpreting agri sector growth at 3.8% during Q2FY18-19. It says, ""First, this is higher than the nominal growth, indicating a negative agri deflator. Second, this growth has mostly been driven by 'livestock products, forestry and fisheries' components, whereas the crop segment including fruits and vegetables has merely expanded. Apart from this, agri NPA for select banks reveals it is increasing and growth in food credit growth continues to remain weak.""

During the second quarter, the livestock products, forestry and fisheries' components grew 6.7%, while crop segment, which also includes fruits and vegetables, having weightage of 45% in overall agriculture, has grown by a mere 0.5%.
This, according to SBI, indicates that agriculture as a profession has been losing its importance because its incentive structure. ""The fact that livestock is gaining traction in agri activities has both an upside and downside. On the upside, a large percentage of livestock belong to small and marginal farmers in India. However, on the downside, merely possession of such livestock does not guarantee an assured income and hence the small and marginal farmers often find themselves in distress. What should worry us the most is the fact that agriculture prices were in negative territory in Q2 (-1.0%),"" it added.
Here are five possible remedies, according to SBI, to ease farmers...
1. Livestock
India is endowed with the largest livestock population in the world. It accounts for about 57% of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs buffalo population and 15% of the cattle population. Thus, if livestock rearing is taken up professionally, this would not only result in increase in income but would also work as a risk diversification for the farming community. Further, livestock is the best insurance for farmers against vagaries of nature like drought and other natural calamities.
SBI says, ""To help boost the livestock income of the farming community it is now imperative that due importance is given to rearing of native cow breeds (A2 milk). A2 is a beta-casein protein in the milkÃ¢ÂÂthat makes milk healthy and nutritious. In India, most Ã¢ÂÂdesiÃ¢ÂÂ cows and buffalo breeds contain A2 allele gene. SBI says, ""To help boost the livestock income of the farming community it is now imperative that due importance is given to rearing of native cow breeds (A2 milk). A2 is a beta-casein protein in the milkÃ¢ÂÂthat makes milk healthy and nutritious. In India, most Ã¢ÂÂdesiÃ¢ÂÂ cows and buffalo breeds contain A2 allele gene.
Internationally, Brazil has become the biggest exporters of Indian breeds of cows. Milk yield from Gir breed (Indian) in Brazil has now crossed 70 litres per day. The growing demand for the A2 milk across the globe means an opportunity for India to give more thrust to research in A2 gene breed and export A2 milk across world.
""We suggest, to boost the demand for A2 milk, it can also be provided in mid-day meals for children at pan India level. This will provide additional income of Rs7,000 per annum for 15.83 million farmers and make livestock rearing an attractive proposition, particularly small and marginal farmers,"" the report says.
2. Better Marketing
According to SBI, better marketing for the produce and efficient supply chain management can minimise the stress in this sector. To aid the farmers, the government has started promoting farmer producer organisations or FPOs that work as a hybrid between a cooperative and a private limited company. These must be promoted in a big way as is being done in Maharashtra.
FPOs act as sub-agents for government agencies in procuring agri commodities of their members under various government schemes. Such companies buy inputs in bulk and make them available to members. They also pool, procure or purchase the output from members and undertake organised marketing on their behalf. They may link up with bankers to channelise credit to the members.

They may undertake the task of organising technology dissemination or extension to members. They can be an NGO, a private company or a government agency, the report says.
A 100% tax deduction for farmer producer companies (FPCs) for the next five years has been announced in the Union Budget 2018. Till now, the companies were being taxed 30% of their profits. An initiative in this direction has also been taken up in the form of Rs2,115 crore State of Maharashtra Agribusiness and Rural Transformation (SMART) Project, which seeks to develop agriculture value chains focusing on new farmers and creation of new markets.
3. Income Support Scheme
According to SBI, a selective income support scheme for the farmers like Rythu Bandhu Scheme in Telengana has to be implemented in the interregnum. It says, ""Our analysis reveals that an income support scheme like the one rolled out in Telangana may be rolled out in states like Bihar, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Punjab, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand where the cost is not prohibitive.""
The Rythu Bandhu Scheme is the first of its kind, wherein the cash is paid directly to the farmer with no leakages. It is providing Rs4,000 per acre per season to 5.83 million farmers to support the farm investment. Telangana government has made an allocation of Rs12,000 crore for this scheme in its 2018-19 budget.
""As per our estimates, this scheme, if implemented at pan India level, the total financial burden could be around Rs2.7 lakh crore for all states based on net sown area,"" SBI says.
4. Tenancy Certificate
There was a suggestion of providing a tenancy certificate to tenant farmers as promised in the budget. However, SBI says it is not sure what has happened to this suggestion which should have been addressed on a war footing. Agricultural tenancy was regulated to protect the tenant. But, the extremely cumbersome formal process at present, has created a high reliance on informal tenancy arrangements. This, in turn, require landlords to constantly monitor tenancy contracts and may leave tenants vulnerable to eviction.
5. Tweaking PM Fasal Bima Yojana
SBI believes some tweaking of the Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is imperative in areas like coverage of crops, timely notification and timely payments.
The PMFBY provides a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of the crop, thus helping in stabilising the income of the farmers. The scheme covers all food and oilseeds crops and annual commercial or horticultural crops for which past yield data is available and for which requisite number of crop cutting experiments (cces) are conducted under general crop estimation survey (GCES). The scheme is implemented by empanelled general insurance companies.
About 21 states implemented the scheme in kharif 2016 whereas 23 states and two Union Territories (UTs) have implemented the scheme in rabi 2016-17. Around 3.7 crore farmers have been insured in the Kharif 2016 for 3.7 crore ha of land at premium of Rs16,212 crore for a sum insured of Rs1,28,568.94 crore as per figures available on 31 March 2017.",5 Ways to Ease Distress of Farmers: SBI
98,695,positive,"Names of places in Chennai are more than just geographical markers. They bring out what Chennai was not too long ago. Lake Area, Tank Bund Road and Eri Scheme are a few pointers that tell us how bountiful the city was in water resources.

Even as recently as in the 1950s, you could drive down Mount Road from Saidapet to Teynampet through what became CIT Nagar, bank left near where Gemini Flyover stands now, hop on to Tank Bund Road and continue motoring along, never too far away from water.

Cut to 2018: Chennai is all built-up and the names of places are just fluid reminders of the past.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs almost summer and the anxiety of Chennaiites is mounting. Despite official assurances, they are worried about how the supply of water will pan out. Today, motoring across roads means conducting tricky negotiations with water tankers that dominate not just our streets but other types of water supply too.

As the global community commemorated World Water Day recently as a reminder to use nature to overcome challenges and discussed the approaching Ã¢ÂÂDay ZeroÃ¢ÂÂ in Cape Town, which is caught in the throes of a severe drought, Chennaiites recognise that their city is also part of the rather dismal scene. Rapid and unplanned urbanisation has systematically destroyed waterbodies, which act as sponges and help mitigate floods.

If the process is left unchecked, Chennai could soon be heading towards an ecological disaster.

Studying depletion

A study by the Department of Geology, Anna University, based on a city map of 1893, has revealed that there were nearly 60 large waterbodies in the core of then Madras. The study traced the shrinking and vanished waterbodies through a series of city maps.

In 2017, the number of waterbodies, both large and small, came down to 28.

Source: Department of Geology, Anna University

The historical map was sourced from the city maps prepared by the Edinburgh Geographical Institute in 1893. The rest of the maps were sourced through land satellite images, according to the team from Anna University.

Ã¢ÂÂWe found that the area of the waterbodies had shrunk rapidly after 1960 and there were drastic changes in the number of lakes or ponds in the core part of the city with every passing decade,Ã¢ÂÂ said Samurembi Chanu, a research scholar who was part of the team. The study covered the areas between Kodungaiyur, Tondiarpet and Guindy that formed the core parts of then Madras.

L. Elango, a member of the faculty at Department of Geology, Anna University, and vice-president of the International Association of Hydrogeologists (Indian chapter), said the area of the waterbodies in the city and suburbs had shrunk from nearly 12.6 sq. km in 1893 to about 3.2 sq. km in 2017, mainly due to urbanisation.

Ã¢ÂÂThe 1893 map indicates the presence of a crescent-shaped waterbody from the present CIT Nagar, Teynampet, Gemini flyover to Nungambakkam along the then Mount Road. The waterbodies, namely Mylapur tank and Nungambakkam tank, covered a distance of nearly 7 km,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

The study aimed at checking the implications of urbanisation and climate change over ground and surface water resources and how the shrinking of open spaces had reduced groundwater recharge.

Ã¢ÂÂVysarpadi Lake, Perambur tank, Medavakkam tank and Spurtank were some of the large waterbodies that were replaced by buildings after the 1950s. While Nandanam was along the lake bund, the present CIT Colony was a waterbody during the 1950s. Kilpauk too had big waterbodies. Many small waterbodies in north Chennai near Tondiarpet have been wiped off city maps due to encroachment and urbanisation, particularly from the 1970s. There were a few ponds near Ice House too. The Madras Zoo that was located behind Ripon building and was later shifted to Vandalur in 1980s had a huge waterbody inside,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mr. Elango.

Impact on groundwater

The study estimated the depleting volume of water harvested and the loss of groundwater recharge as more waterbodies vanished over the decades. Ã¢ÂÂWe estimated that if the average depth of lakes and ponds was 2 metres and filled twice during a year, the volume of surface water stored has dipped from 1,335 million cubic feet (mcft) in 1893 to 339 mcft in 2017, going by the shrinking water spread area,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

The vanished waterbodies and open spaces also mean a drastic drop in groundwater recharge potential, according to the study.

The rapid loss of natural resources has induced local flooding and increased saltwater intrusion in the coastal belt, noted water experts. They recalled a research project of IIT-Madras that estimated the existence of 650 waterbodies in the Chennai region till the late 1970s.

Every episode of local flooding in the city can be traced to a vanished waterbody in the neighbourhood M. Karmegam Former director, Centre for Water Resources, Anna University

S.P. Chairman, retired engineer, Water Resources Department, said some of the railway stations, including in Kodambakkam and Nungambakkam, were developed over lakes. A sizeable chunk of Chennai Central railway station was built above the Buckingham canal. Several ponds in Kolathur have yielded to infrastructure development.

Ã¢ÂÂUntil the 1960s, there was a big lake in Perambur on the site now developed as a park beneath the flyover. Low-level areas face inundation as lakes have been destroyed. The industrial estates in Guindy and Ambattur were also water bodies,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Man-made flooding

The Chennai floods of 2015 were a clear indicator of mismanagement of lakes and negligence in protecting linking channels. M. Karmegam, former director, Centre for Water Resources, Anna University, recalled that there was a chain of 16 tanks in Vyasarpadi, among which was the one in Kodungaiyur. After 1950, many have been turned into settlements, including in Ayapakkam and Koladi. The Public Works Department used to maintain tank memoirs with hydraulic details of tanks during the British period. Every episode of local flooding in the city can be traced to a vanished waterbody in the neighbourhood, he added.

Waterbodies have a role in temperature regulation, prevention of water-borne diseases and groundwater stabilisation Arun Krishnamurthi Environmentalist Foundation of India

Environmental activists noted that the trend was not new to the suburbs either. Arun Krishnamurthy, Founder of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), noted that small ponds were easy prey as there weren't any proper revenue records. Ponds have been closed to build overhead tanks in Tiruvottiyur, Palavakkam and Thoraipakkam.

Ã¢ÂÂThere are different versions of documentation on waterbodies which were denotified during changes in land-use pattern. Every waterbody has a role in temperature regulation, prevention of water-borne diseases and groundwater stabilisation,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Coping with the loss

EFI is now involved in rejuvenating smaller ponds to sustain the ecological balance in areas such as Madhavaram, Gerugambakkam, Sholinganallur and Mudichur. With intense rainfall in short spells predicted to increase and bring more rainwater runoff in the city, experts call for a restoration of shrinking waterbodies and monitoring of rainwater harvesting on a large scale.

The study recommends demarcation of groundwater protection zones, construction of check dams across waterways and additional subsurface storage tanks to cope with the loss of natural resources over the past century and adapt to climate change.",The vanishing waterbodies of Chennai
99,704,positive,"The killing of Avni has outraged people across the nation because, in a sense, it represents the same senseless violence that appears to have gripped us in recent years. And the politics behind this tragic killing appears to have the same sense of dÃÂ©jÃ vu. How people in power use a conflict situation as an opportunity to grab land (hundreds of hectares of precious forest land in this case) and sell it at a throwaway price to their business cronies. And, once again, the same names reappear as beneficiaries.

But letÃ¢ÂÂs start at the beginning. Who was Avni? Avni was a six-year-old tigress, the mother of two ten-month-old cubs. She was officially known as T1.

AvniÃ¢ÂÂs home was Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district. Pandharkawada is a small forest being rapidly encroached upon by the locals as well as those who come in search of lime, coal and dolomite. For a mere Rs 40 crore, almost 500 hectares of the forest was given away (you could say almost gifted) by the government to Anil Ambani, currently much in the news for the Dassault offsets. Ambani was to set up a cement plant there. The plant, of course, got promptly sold off-lock, stock and barrel to another business house for Rs 4,800 crore, thus benchmarking the landÃ¢ÂÂs actual value.

While Avni and her mate were planning a family, which would have in turn grown the tiger population in the forest, several industrial groups were also eyeing the land. There was another cement plant coming up there as well as a power plant. Others were also lining up, eager to grab a part of the forest and, as we all know, there were ministers in the Congress (and in the current BJP) always ready to sign away forest land. It is a big business today. But Avni didnÃ¢ÂÂt know that. She saw it as her home.

Luckily, tiger habitats are not easy to give away- for the tiger is a protected species. So Avni became a headache. There was only one way to get rid of her- to spread the lie that she was a man-eater. That is very easy to do in a place like Yavatmal, often referred to as IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs suicide capital. Years of neglect of local farmers, successive droughts, lack of irrigation, missed monsoons, mounting debts and frequent crop failures have brought the region to its knees. Promised loan reliefs never came. Things are so bad there that people are even ready to kill themselves for a paltry compensation so that their families may live. In this tragic (and unfortunate) situation, claiming compensation from wildlife deaths could fetch someoneÃ¢ÂÂs family three times more money than death from drinking pesticide or hanging from a tree.

That is why it was convenient to pin the moniker of a man-eater on Avni. Every death that took place out there, natural or unnatural, began to be attributed to her.

This campaign was started by the stateÃ¢ÂÂs minister of forests himself, Sudhir Mungantiwar, who has been accused by his own party leader Maneka Gandhi (a former Union minister of environment and forests and renowned for her work among animals) of being on a killing spree since he became minister. Ã¢ÂÂI am shockedÃ¢ÂÂ, she said, Ã¢ÂÂthat such a man is allowed to hold this portfolio.Ã¢ÂÂ She also pointed out that the murder of Avni- stealthily and in the dead of night, violating every wildlife law of the country- was Ã¢ÂÂnothing but a straight case of crime. Despite requests from his own forest department and people all over India, Mungantiwar gave the order to kill.Ã¢ÂÂ

And whom did he hire for the kill? A shooter called Nawab Shafat Ali Khan from Hyderabad, with a history of many run-ins with the law. In 2005, the Karnataka CID (forests) caught him for illegal shooting expeditions-punishable under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. KSN Chikkerur, former IG of CID (forests), described him as Ã¢ÂÂa very trigger-happy manÃ¢ÂÂ. But the charges against him are not just limited to poaching. In 1991-92, the Karnataka police had arrested him for allegedly supplying weapons to Maoists operating along the Andhra-Odisha boundary.

To justify the killing, recent deaths in the region were blamed on Avni-all 13 of them. DNA tests, however, were only done on three, and two of them showed signs of a tiger kill. But none of those tests conclusively proved it was Avni who was responsible.

Yet, the campaign continued. Stories were spread about how Avni had become a threat. By law, a man-eater is a tiger that kills humans for food and, till the very end, there was no evidence that Avni had ever killed humans for food. In fact, conservationists will tell you that tigers see humans as predators, not prey. The notion of a man-eater is ridiculously old-fashioned, created by the British to justify hunting. But Mungantiwar kept shouting from the rooftops. And as the rumours grew, secret plans were laid out on how to kill Avni. The Nawab was brought in. His CV declared that he had killed 250 nilgai in Bihar in public interest.

Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Preeti S Menon has, in an article, described how many NGOs were ready to offer tonnes of fodder to the villagers to stop them from grazing in the forest and there was even a proposal to solar-fence the forest zone. But the minister was adamant. Avni had to go. Even the courts urged restraint. Maneka Gandhi promised to bring in an expert team from Madhya Pradesh to tranquilise and relocate Avni. But the minister kept assuring everyone that the Nawab would only be an observer while the veterinary teams would trap the tigress and her cubs, as per the law.

What finally happened was a cold-blooded murder. The NawabÃ¢ÂÂs son-Asghar Ali, who (some claim) was not even authorised-slunk into the forest in the night, violating all regulations, and shot Avni dead. Like in all fake encounters, the excuse was lame: Ã¢ÂÂThe tigress attacked usÃ¢ÂÂ. What did you expect it to do when you sneaked up on her and her cubs at night? Forensic tests, however, disprove even that. They reveal that the bullet went through her shoulder, passed through the ribs and came out through the other shoulder. This clearly shows Avni was not attacking them at all but going away into the forest, to avoid a confrontation. Those who have examined the body say a tranquiliser gun was fired at her long after she had been killed, to prove that attempts were made to capture her alive. And all this while the law says you cannot tranquilise a tiger at night.

Also, as per sources, Avni was shot by a .300 Win rifle which has a bullet diameter of 7.62 mm and the bullet weight is about 11.50 gm. This is not a caliber permitted for shooting tigers as per NTCA guidelines. Also, the rifle had a night vision thermal scope attached to it to aid shooting in complete darkness. Why would you need that if you were not shooting her at night, violating all laws? Attempts are also being made to replace the bullet which was recovered from AvniÃ¢ÂÂs body with a 33.10 gm bullet used in a .458 Win Mag rifle which the shooters claim they used for the shoot. A letter has been issued to the Nawab and his son to deposit their rifle and a live cartridge for ballistic testing. But they have moved the weapon out of the state and have not complied with the order. Rumours say that attempts are being made to use political influence in Delhi to get that letter withdrawn.

Avni is dead. Her cubs lie orphaned and will probably die. They are too young to hunt for food on their own. The minister is strutting around, boasting his decision and making offensive statements against Maneka Gandhi for exposing him. And the forests, as usual, are up for sale, while the locals barely manage to eke out their indigent existence.

The people want a probe. They want the forests minister to go. But will he have the dignity to step down? Or will the chief minister have to take a call on this? And will he?",Avni: A wanton killing

His actions drew the ire of the DMK, whose cadre staged a black flag protest near the venue of a programme which Mr. Purohit was attending.

After an early morning visit to the famed Sri Brihadeeswarar Temple (also known as the Ã¢ÂÂBig TempleÃ¢ÂÂ), the Governor hit the road, encouraging residents to keep hygiene and sanitation close to their heart. Inagurating a road show at the New Bus Stand with his now-customary sweep for the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Governor called upon the public to unite, resolve, educate and motivate one another to keep the environment clean.

Keeping the city clean was everybodyÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility, he said, adding that people should not unload everything on the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs shoulders and expect its agencies alone to do the job. Cleanliness prevented communicable diseases, and hence, must be prioritised, he said.

Later, Mr. Purohit, with his Secretary R. Rajagopal in tow, was briefed by Collector A. Annadurai on the progress being made on ongoing projects.

Shortly thereafter, the Governor received petitions from individuals and organisations representing various sections of society, including a host of farmersÃ¢ÂÂ bodies. The farmersÃ¢ÂÂ associations detailed the problems facing the members of their community in the Delta region, and impressed upon the Governor the need for the Central government to constitute the Cauvery Management Board immediately and to ensure that Karnataka releases Tamil NaduÃ¢ÂÂs due share of Cauvery water. They also highlighted the plight of farmers who had not received the crop insurance amounts for the previous year and sought his intervention on that front.

Their shut-down entered the fourth day on Monday. They are demanding release of nine shopkeepers, who were arrested for rioting last week demanding the the notification on ban be revoked.On Monday, the judicial magistrateÃ¢ÂÂs court in Danta rejected their bail pleas and sent them to judicial custody.The pilgrims woes are likely to be compounded as the owners of guest houses have joined the traders' agitation and stopped taking bookings. Nearly three million people are expected to congregate in Ambaji for the fair, which begins on September 19 and culminates September 25.This is the first time in the history of Bhadarvi Poonam fair that the temple town is witnessing an unrest by locals.

In just over a month, till February 11 this year, at least five individual cases of poaching of the Indian pangolin have come to light.

Though on the verge of extinction, pangolins or scaly anteaters -- among the most traded animals in the world that has now found a local market in India -- is yet to catch the attention of the Union government.

With the Environment Ministry keeping its eyes shut to the crisis, saying the animal was ""not yet threatened"" or calling it a ""state-subject"", poaching and trading of Pangolins has grown into an organised wildlife crime, being carried out by the same syndicates that are involved in tiger poaching, according to experts.

Reports show that at least 6,000 pangolins have been slaughtered in India since 2009 for their expensive scales, which are sold for their so-called aphrodisiac properties, though this aspect is yet unproven, scientifically.

In just over a month, till February 11 this year, at least five individual cases of poaching of the Indian pangolin have come to light, with about 13 kg of scales seized, estimated to be harvested by killing 14 to 26 animals.

The Union Environment Ministry, though, still considers it too early to act.

""It is not something that is going extinct. We (Centre) take up protection of species which are threatened. Pangolin is not threatened yet,"" Director General of Forests in the Environment Ministry, Siddhant Das, told IANS, adding, ""It's a state subject.""

He also said that so far the Centre has no plans for its conservation.

However, experts and records disagree. India is home to two of the eight pangolin species found across Asia and Africa -- the Indian pangolin and Chinese pangolin.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Pangolin is enlisted in ""red-list"", with the Indian pangolin listed as ""endangered"" and the Chinese pangolin listed ""critically endangered"" -- a step behind ""extinction"".

Pangolin is a mammal with ants as its primary prey. Its tongue is longer than its body to help it catch as many as 20,000 ants per day. The species is threatened due to its scale, made of keratin -- like human nails.

According to a senior ministry official, demand for pangolin scales are largely in south Asian countries. However, recent investigations have shown that India is emerging as a new market.

""We have got indications that they are also being consumed locally in India -- partly for medicinal purposes and partly for superstition,"" Dr Saket Badola, Head of Traffic-India, a wildlife trade monitoring network and part of WWF, told IANS.

In some parts of country, pangolin meat is also consumed as a delicacy, he added. Among the parts of the animal which have been seized recently, most has been meat. ""Countries which have taken up studies show that their population is dropping, mostly due to poaching,"" Badola said.

""There is a huge network working -- maximum seizures were from border area of Manipur and ports of Tamil Nadu,"" Badola said.

Realising the threat, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an international agreement between governments, listed pangolin under Appendix-I in October 2016, barring its trade across the globe. In India too, the species is listed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972.

In India, it is currently the most poached animal, with central India -- Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra -- emerging as the the most preferred poaching grounds.

According to Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), out of five poaching cases in 2018, two were from Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh, of about 7 kg of scales. Among these cases was one where local smugglers -- including a government official -- offered to sell 12 kg of scales for Rs 50,000 a kg. Only 5 kg of the scales could be seized by authorities, though.

""Its now an organised wildlife crime and it's time to get serious,"" Tito Joseph from WPSI told IANS.

In 2016, there were a total 22 cases of seizures, included the three biggest ones so far -- 123 kg of scales in May, 93 kg in June from Mizoram and 86 kg at New Delhi Railway station, seized by a CBI team. Four people were arrested in Delhi, all of whom are out on bail now.

According to eminent scientist Dr Y.V. Jhala from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), there is ""not a single study"" on the habitat, behaviour or population estimate of the pangolin.

Officials tracking pangolin poaching say they lack resources to tackle the problem.

The $44 billion refinery was seen as a game changer for both parties Ã¢ÂÂ offering India steady fuel supplies and meeting Saudi ArabiaÃ¢ÂÂs need to secure regular buyers for its oil.
But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood.
Ã¢ÂÂThe entire (land acquisition) process has been stayed. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt acquired any land,"" Fadnavis told state assembly on Wednesday as opposition parties and a coalition partner Shiv Sena were opposing the refinery.
The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing.
RRPL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless.
Issues related to the land for the refinery will be sorted out by the state government soon given the importance of the project, RRPL Chief Executive officer B. Ashok told Reuters.
Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for their livelihood.

On November 12, Bishnu Mondal was picnicking at the popular Wandoor beach in the Andaman Islands when he dived into the waters and never emerged. Then someone caught a glimpse of him and screamed.

MondalÃ¢ÂÂs friends Ã¢ÂÂ men in their twenties, all migrant construction workers Ã¢ÂÂ rushed in to help. The group had been swimming inside a tattered safety net, meant to shield revellers from the reptiles of the Lohabarrack Crocodile Sanctuary a few hundred metres away. A 16-ft crocodile was entangled in the net. It had Mondal by the neck.

The men yanked out the poles holding the net together and approached, hoping to thrash the beast into submission. But nobody dared go too close.

By now, hundreds had gathered. Some turned on their cellphone cameras, others scrambled to get help. The lifeguard said he was trained in CPR, not croc attacks. The Wandoor wildlife department said the rescue equipment was at their headquarters, 30 minutes away at Port Blair. The police also put their hands up: Ã¢ÂÂOur duty is on the land, not the sea,Ã¢ÂÂ said a constable.

FROM TOO FEWÃ¢ÂÂ¦ TO TOO MANY? Saltwater crocodiles were poached heavily until the 1960s, for skin, meat and as trophies.

By the 1970s, there were only 31 salties in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, according to a Wildlife Institute of India report.

The Indian government launched Project Crocodile in 1975, making killing a saltie punishable by up to seven years in prison.

The government also began breeding the crocs at the Haddo zoo in Port Blair, for release in the islandsÃ¢ÂÂ creeks and streams.

By 2015, the saltie population had grown to an estimated 500, according to estimates by the A&N forest department.

While their numbers have grown, contributing to the man-croc conflict, so have ours. The human population of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands rose from 41,000 in 1951 to 3.8 lakh by 2011, according to Census data.

The number of tourists has risen from 430,000 in 2016 to 500,000 in 2017.

According to the forest department, there have been six croc attacks since 2014; media reports peg the number at 15.

By the time a wildlife patrol steamer roared in from Port Blair, it was too late. Rescue men pulled up next to the animal and jabbed a harpoon in its back. It let go, and the body of Mondal, 21 Ã¢ÂÂ a brother, son, uncle, friend Ã¢ÂÂ sank into the depths.

Over the following week, the wildlife department laid traps along the Wandoor coast and caught five crocodiles. One was a suspected man-eater; it had been caught, marked and released after a similar attack on a Home Guard in 2015, but had returned to the same spot Ã¢ÂÂ not unusual, given their homing instincts.

The residents of Wandoor were livid. The crocodile menace, they said, had only been growing in recent years. An endangered species in the 1970s, these predators were now often spotted in creeks and streams. To them, it was an unintended consequence of a successful four-decade conservation programme led by the union environment ministry.

Since the 1970s, the saltwater croc population in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has grown from 31 to an estimated 500. The human population has gone from 41,000 in 1951 to 3.8 lakh in 2011. ( Omkar Khandekar )

Saltwater crocodiles, known as Ã¢ÂÂsaltiesÃ¢ÂÂ, are native to eastern India, South-East Asia and Northern Australia. Before conservation efforts started in these countries in the 1960s, they were often poached for their skin, meat and as trophy kills.

According to a report published by the Wildlife Institute of India in 1999, salties in the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (A&N) numbered only about 31 by the 1970s.

The Indian government launched its conservation effort, Project Crocodile, in 1975. Saltwater crocodiles, like tigers and rhinoceroses, were given Ã¢ÂÂSchedule 1Ã¢ÂÂ protection under the new Wildlife Protection Act. Their killing was punishable up to seven years in prison. In the newly constructed Haddo zoo in Port Blair, they were bred for release in the creeks and streams.

A possibility of conflict with humans could never be completely eliminated, but it was not considered probable that such conflict would occur, given the small numbers. After all, the islandsÃ¢ÂÂ aboriginal people had coexisted with them for millennia.

According to the forest department of A&N, there have been six croc attacks since 2014; media reports peg the number at 15. Either way, the stakes are high, for the islandÃ¢ÂÂs residents and its tourism economy. The number of tourists coming to A&N has risen from 430,000 in 2016 to 500,000 in 2017, also raising the risk of more attacks.

Ã¢ÂÂPar yahan aisa hai,Ã¢ÂÂ says a local resident and contract worker with the local government, Ã¢ÂÂki jab baarish rahega tabhi chatri ki yaad aati hai (But the way it is here, officials only start to think about an umbrella once the downpour has begun).Ã¢ÂÂ

Shankar Biswas was attacked in his field. ( Omkar Khandekar )

One way to read this is as a tale of animal conservation gone wrong. Streams, creeks and coasts in the south Andamans are now dotted with signposts that say: Ã¢ÂÂBeware of CrocodilesÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂNever dangle hands or legs during boat ridesÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂPlease avoid entering into the seaÃ¢ÂÂ. At one end of the Wandoor beach, the warnings turn rather sinister: Ã¢ÂÂSurvivors will be prosecutedÃ¢ÂÂ.

But the bigger picture is more complex. As the population of crocodiles grew, that of humans boomed. The crocodile habitat in A&N had been shrinking steadily ever since the Indian government began encouraging human settlements in the largely virgin 572-island chain, since 1947.

In 1949, tens of thousands of refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan were moved here. Over the following decades, thousands more headed to the islands from across India. In 1951, the population of A&N was roughly 41,000; by 2011, it had grown to 3.8 lakh, according to the Census.

As the government doled out land parcels for cultivation and opened up the seas for fishing, many entered areas near crocodile nesting sites.

On December 26, 2004, a tsunami struck South and South-East Asia. Waves up to 6 metres high invaded the islands, killing nearly 2,000 people, submerging villages and displacing about 40,000 residents.

Apart from damages worth billions of rupees, the earthquake also caused a movement of tectonic plates. The northern part of Andaman rose by 1.5 metres and the southern sunk by 1.2 metres. By the wildlife departmentÃ¢ÂÂs assessments, it caused the crocodiles in the north to move down to the south. The result: crocodile sightings Ã¢ÂÂ and conflict Ã¢ÂÂ started increasing in these villages. On average, attacks on humans rose to two a year.

In the clusters of small islands interconnected by streams and creeks, residents fishing for dinner or a living, tourists out for a swim, could come face to face with a croc. ( Omkar Khandekar )

Residents started realising something wasnÃ¢ÂÂt quite right when cattle, if kept in waterlogged fields, started to go missing. In 2005, Sukhada Sil from the Wandoor panchayat noticed a 4-metre something lurking around the local jetty. That year in Wandoor marked the end of the Durga Pujo tradition of entering the waters for idol immersion.

The forest department conducts awareness workshops in towns, panchayats and schools. Saltwater crocodiles, they explain, are opportunistic predators, meaning they eat any meat they can find. Too often, residents dump dead fish, kitchen and poultry waste into the islandsÃ¢ÂÂ network of streams, creeks and the sea. This attracts stray dogs, smaller animals and, at times, crocodiles.

But the residents have been using the interconnected streams for fishing and waste disposal for decades. Ã¢ÂÂMost of us here are Bengalis,Ã¢ÂÂ says Ashim Dhali, 31, a farm labourer from Manpur village. Ã¢ÂÂA Bengali has to have fish three times a day. We canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to buy it all, so we also catch our own.Ã¢ÂÂ

We have to evolve a system to safeguard the interests of forest [department], tourists and locals. But we need time, technology. Until then, restrict tourism. When you value a life, that is the solution.Ã¢ÂÂ Naveen Kumar, deputy conservator of forests at Port Blair

In March 2015, a crocodile lunged at Dhali during a pre-dinner expedition at a neighbourhood stream. It sunk its teeth into his left arm and then his right leg. Dhali rammed his fingers in the reptileÃ¢ÂÂs eyes and crawled to safety. For months after, he says, he would wake up at odd hours, drenched in sweat. It was always the same dream: heÃ¢ÂÂs standing on an edge, someone pushes him from behind.

Jasinta Terkey, a 62-year-old farmer from Tusnabad, wasnÃ¢ÂÂt as lucky. In September 2016, a crocodile attacked her as she was washing her lunch plate at a nallah in her backyard. Furious at seeing her corpse in the jaws of the animal, her neighbours stormed into the waters.

Ã¢ÂÂThey grabbed sticks, slippers, axes,Ã¢ÂÂ recalls Sarita Devi, the victimÃ¢ÂÂs daughter-in-law. Ã¢ÂÂThey killed the crocodile.Ã¢ÂÂ

After the first attack on Wandoor beach in 2015, the wildlife officials put up nylon safety nets to keep swimmers and crocs apart. Two monsoons and a cyclone later, the net had slumped off its poles.

The death of Mondal acted as a wake-up call. Beaches at Wandoor, CorbynÃ¢ÂÂs Cove and Munda Pahar in south Andaman were declared no-swimming zones. The authorities also shut down Radhanagar beach in the neighbouring Havelock Islands for three days in November, after local fisherman spotted crocodile paw marks nearby.

Ã¢ÂÂThere are very few countries where a problem of man-saltie conflict exists,Ã¢ÂÂ says Naveen Kumar, deputy conservator of forests at Port Blair. Ã¢ÂÂIn Australia, authorities have the liberty to take down the animal when it grows beyond 4 to 5 metres. But our law is conservation-oriented.Ã¢ÂÂ

At the current rate, he added, such instances will rise. Ã¢ÂÂWe have to evolve a system to safeguard the interests of all, forest [department], tourists and locals. But we need time, we need technology.Ã¢ÂÂ

It might take up to 10-15 years to test the efficacy of its ongoing pilot projects Ã¢ÂÂ grille-gates along high-risk streams; chain-link fences along streams and creeks; polypropylene-net enclosures for swimmers Ã¢ÂÂ and come up with a comprehensive safety plan with all measures in place. And until then? Ã¢ÂÂRestrict tourism. When you value a life, that is the solution.Ã¢ÂÂ

The tourism industry isnÃ¢ÂÂt going to be as patient. Over the past 18 months, the number of daily flights to A&N has doubled to 30. Last year, the industry had an annual turnover of about Rs 1,300 crore and employed nearly a quarter of the islandsÃ¢ÂÂ 4 lakh people. A boom is predicted.

Technically, weÃ¢ÂÂve only had one crocodile attack on a tourist. No new tourist sites will be opened without precautions. The crocodile population is also an opportunity. We can promote sightings.Ã¢ÂÂ Amit Anand, director of tourism with the Andaman & Nicobar Administration

Ã¢ÂÂTechnically, weÃ¢ÂÂve only had one crocodile attack on a tourist till now,Ã¢ÂÂ says director of tourism Amit Anand. He was referring to an American woman killed while snorkelling off Havelock Island in 2010. In the aftermath of the Wandoor attack, Anand said no new tourist sites would be opened up without proper safety precautions and scientific study.

Ã¢ÂÂThe crocodile population is also an opportunity for us,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂIn areas where they are present, we can promote sightings.Ã¢ÂÂ Indeed, the Cage of Death experience, where humans in glass enclosures are lowered into a crocodile pond, is already a sought-after tourist attraction in Darwin, Australia.

But in the Andamans, initiatives to remedy the man-crocodile conflict hinge on a larger debate: To whom do the islands belong? Tarun Nair, member of the Crocodile Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, is unconvinced with the current approach in the Andamans.

Ã¢ÂÂPutting up nets in the sea gives a false sense of security. Relocating a crocodile after an attack doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work because they are known to come back to the same site. Terming animals Ã¢ÂÂman-eatersÃ¢ÂÂ is inherently problematic. If you present yourself as prey, a crocodile will take you.Ã¢ÂÂ

The best way ahead, he says, is promoting awareness about animal behaviour and taking better precautions. Ã¢ÂÂIn this ecosystem, we are not the top organism,Ã¢ÂÂ he adds. Ã¢ÂÂOnce we acknowledge that, half the problem is solved.Ã¢ÂÂ

108,760,positive,"In a staggering conservation success, IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs tigers have increased in number from 1,411 in 2006 to 2,226 at last count, and fingers are crossed that the 2018 All India Tiger Estimation will reveal a stable or even bigger population. But tigers depend upon quality tree cover, which is desperately hard to sustain in a country with over 1.3 billion people and a booming economy.

How best to protect IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forests is the subject of intense debate. But all who have studied and worked on the issue agree that the forests and treed landscapes where tigers live are among the key priorities.

Protecting tigers and their habitats Ã¢ÂÂsecure[s] the natural capital and ecosystem services required to underpin economic expansion,Ã¢ÂÂ says the World Wildlife Fund. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also crucial for the nationÃ¢ÂÂs human population: about 600 rivers arise in or are fed by tiger reserves, producing water for hundreds of millions of Indians. Corbett Tiger Reserve, the oldest in the country, purifies drinking water for Delhi, the capital and a megacity of 19 million.

There is a further vital argument that is not immediately apparent. IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forest landscapes would fare far less well without the big cats. Forests with tigers are in better health and richer in carbon than those without. There is less illegal extraction of lumber. The forests are a mecca for tourists, which creates jobs. And the scrutiny and oversight by the government are greater.

The presence of predators also has a beneficial effect that was documented most famously in Yellowstone Park. The reintroduction of wolves there in 1995 after their eradication in the 1920s, triggered a trophic cascade that restored the park, whose ecosystem had been damaged by an unchecked elk population. By hunting the elk, the wolves allowed aspen and other vegetation to return. Erosion diminished, rivers ran clean and the park recovered.

Dino Martins, who directs Princeton UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs Mpala Research Center in Kenya, has witnessed similar positive effects of lions in that country He says the importance of predators is generalizable, an axiom of ecology. EarthÃ¢ÂÂs habitats, he says, Ã¢ÂÂare built around invisible rules that have come about from tens of millions of years of species co-existing,Ã¢ÂÂ says Martins, who studied with E.O. Wilson. Ã¢ÂÂRemoving key players like tigers has a ripple effect on all other species. Having them in place creates a healthier ecosystem.Ã¢ÂÂ

But how can tigers and, with them, their valuable landscapes be sustained? Preventing poaching and community education are two obvious ways to reduce tiger deaths, which currently occur at about two a week. But agroforestry and forested corridors that allow tigers to move safely between one reserve and another are probably the most fundamental.

Agroforestry is the deliberate integration of trees with crops and livestock. An ancient practice, it is now high on the science and development agenda. Carefully selected for their functional traits such as the ability to fix nitrogen, the trees provide shade, a more clement microclimate, greater soil fertility and ability to hold water, a refuge for pollinators and birds and insects that control pests, and other so-called Ã¢ÂÂecosystem services.Ã¢ÂÂ

The trees also provide a myriad of vital goods such as fuel, poles, fruit, nuts, timber and food for livestock, reducing the need for rural people to degrade forests and, in the case of India, reducing the risk that they will encounter tigers. Faced with people, tigers usually slink away; but along with leopards and lions, tigers kill an estimated 70 Indians a year.

None of this is theoretical to Lakshmi Bomachar, 26. It is her daily life. The young farmer lives near Pench Tiger reserve in Central India. The reserve is some distance from her home, and she says she is not frightened to be out at duskÃ¢ÂÂthe time of day, along with dawn, when tigers hunt. But later, the veterinarian for the reserve, Akhilesh Mishra, acknowledges that the area Ã¢ÂÂis loaded with tigers.Ã¢ÂÂ

Lakshmi is a committed member of a tree planting program. Its aim is to improve the habitat for tigers and the well-being of people in and near a corridor that runs from Pench to Kanha Tiger Reserve. Led by the Indian social enterprise organization Grow-Trees.com, it also creates jobs in nurseries and tending trees. As the light fades, she checks on a seedling she planted under the program. Patting its leaves, she says Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs like raising a child.Ã¢ÂÂ

Renewing forested corridors to make them more attractive for both tigers and their prey is essential because tigers must disperse. Ã¢ÂÂEven if just one or two sub-adult males manage to make it through a corridor and breed in a new area, the genetic benefit is huge,Ã¢ÂÂ says Jonathan Scott of BBCÃ¢ÂÂs Big Cats Diary. Ã¢ÂÂNone of our tiger populations are large enough unless they are connected.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ says Anish Andheria, the charismatic scientist who leads the Indian NGO Wildlife Conservation Trust.

Grow-Trees.com also offers farmers like Lakshmi a selection of trees to plant around their homes and in fields to reduce their dependency on the forests themselves. India has the largest cattle population in the world, and rural folk graze their livestock within them. They also take forest products to sell and for their own subsistence.

With any luck, besides making Lakshmi safer, the practice of agroforestry will improve the productivity of her farm, make her more prosperous and relieve her of the burden of collecting fuel over long distances. Ã¢ÂÂWe have to wean people off forests and move to agroforestry,Ã¢ÂÂ says Andheria. Reeling off other benefits of agroforestry, he says hedges of trees around farms can keep away wildlife that stray out of forests, and produce fodder that can be cut and carried to cattle tethered on farms. Currently most Indian cattle roam freely, browsing and trampling regenerating trees. Ã¢ÂÂGrazing is a very inefficient way of using forest. The biggest enemy of the forest is grazing and fuel wood collection.Ã¢ÂÂ

Every tree planted under the Grow-Trees.com program belongs to the community, a fact that has won over LakshmiÃ¢ÂÂs village, Karwahi. And the organization has proof that its model pleases tigers too. One corridor replenished with new trees is already attracting tigers back. ""Foresters have found a tiger frequenting the area of our Trees for Tigers project in Rajasthan,"" says Grow-Trees.com founder, Pradip Shah, referring to his NGOÃ¢ÂÂs work in another Indian state. There is clear evidence that tiger prey is plentiful inside reserves, and that tigers are breeding well. And the Indian government has adopted a landmark National Agroforestry Policy to incentivize farmers to plant trees on their land, which should relieve pressure on natural forest.

Nevertheless, the going remains hard. Almost daily, scientists like Andheria and veterinarians like Mishra bear the shock of bad news. Tigers are electrocuted by poachers who put out live wires to kill boar and deer. Ã¢ÂÂVillagers used pesticide to kill two tigers who had killed a cow,Ã¢ÂÂ said a forest guard in LakshmiÃ¢ÂÂs village. And the corridors themselves are under threat.

Ã¢ÂÂCorridors are thinning, and changes like widening roads adversely affect large catsÃ¢ÂÂ natural instinct to disperse,Ã¢ÂÂ says Naveen Pandey, another veterinarian who is also Corbett FoundationÃ¢ÂÂs deputy director. The result can be deadly. On December 29, Ã¢ÂÂT2,Ã¢ÂÂ a father of over 20 cubs and the dominant male in his reserve, was killed on a road that should have been designed to allow safe passage. Ã¢ÂÂThe forest departmentÃ¢ÂÂs hard work of protecting T2 for over eight years was undone by another arm of government as it ignored the need for underpasses,Ã¢ÂÂ tweeted Andheria. Ã¢ÂÂExperts blamed lack of planning by the highway authority,Ã¢ÂÂ said the Times of India.

Ã¢ÂÂThis government is very pro-development,Ã¢ÂÂ explains Rahul Khot, curator of the Bombay Natural History Society. Ã¢ÂÂWe are seeing very fast change. Certain laws have been diluted. Before, 90 percent of landholders had to consent to a development; now itÃ¢ÂÂs only 50 percent. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs tremendous pressure.Ã¢ÂÂ India's growing population is expected to peak at 1.7 billion in 2060.

But broad principles exist as to how restore a tiger corridor, even if Andheria says Ã¢ÂÂreviving a dead one is a helluva job.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂUse science from the beginning,Ã¢ÂÂ says Khot. And work with the local people. Ã¢ÂÂWe spent a year just to gel,Ã¢ÂÂ says Grow-Trees.comÃ¢ÂÂs Bikrant Tiwary.

Other good practices are promoting agroforestry on farms around the corridor; rooting out invasive species, like the Central American plant Lantana camara, which suppresses other plants and creates a thorny tangle through which even tigers struggle to move; encouraging a wide range of forest trees. Madhya Pradesh has an impressive 168 species of trees. Forests stands or expanses of single species are inimical to wildlife: Ã¢ÂÂPlantations of teak could well be the single biggest cause of loss of biodiversity,Ã¢ÂÂ says Pradip Krishen, author of a magisterial book The Jungle Trees of Central India.

Ã¢ÂÂIt would be very easy to say, Ã¢ÂÂwhatÃ¢ÂÂs the point?Ã¢ÂÂ says, big-cat zoologist Jonathan Scott. But he and other advocates for tigers and sustainable development in India feel nothing of the sort. Even tough-talking Andheria is upbeat. Ã¢ÂÂDespite the Herculean problems we face in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂinequity, drying rivers, raging unemployment, hostile neighborsÃ¢ÂÂa large carnivore that is considered dangerous to humans is allowed to do well. While we canÃ¢ÂÂt bathe in this success forever, to have wild tigers do well right into the 21st century is astounding.Ã¢ÂÂ","In India, Agroforestry Is a Win for Both Tigers and Villagers"

Apurva Prakash, Assistant Production Engineer of Farm Power Machinery, Punjab Agricultural University said that due to the high price, less number of farm equipment have been procured.
""In Punjab and nearby states people have started using the machine. Earlier, the usage was low as the cost was very high. Now, the government has decided to provide a subsidy, following which a number of farmers are procuring it,"" Prakash said.
The Punjab government is building an infrastructure of straw management machinery by providing up to 50 per cent of subsidy.
Meanwhile, Pradeep Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana, denied the claims of Balbir Singh Rajewal, saying that sufficient machines are available and that the farmers are being provided with the tools at a high subsidy.
""As per our data, there was need of only 550 machineries and around 540 of them has been ordered. The subsidy has also been approved by the government. There is no such issue as claimed by the farmers,"" he said.
He further said that they are closely looking into the issue of stubble burning as the harvest season is approaching. A vigorous campaign has also been launched to aware farmers about the ill-effects of burning the dry crop.
The Punjab government is also considering a proposal to bar farmers from contesting Panchayat election if found guilty of burning their stubble.
Following the directions of the Supreme Court, the Centre approved a large amount for modern tools and technology.
In the Union Budget 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had assured to provide assistance to the Government of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi Capital Territory (NCT) to deal with the worsening air quality.
The decision came after Delhi's air pollution levels spiked last year, leaving the people gasping for breath.

110,764,positive,"First on August 9 this year and now recently on November 29-30, 2018, peasant organisations held massive demonstrations in the national capital. Earlier, there was a kisan march in Mumbai as well. Issues for the farmers include waiver of loans, subsidy for crops and a mandatory procurement of crops by government, and an acceptance of the MSP-C2+50 percent equation for assessing the minimum price of crops, with C2 being the sum of paid out costs, imputed value of family labour, interest on the value of owned capital assets, rent paid for leased-in land and the rental value of owned land.
FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ movements across India became poignant after several instances of atrocities on them. During the last two years of the NDA regime, there have been several cases of firing on farmers: six were killed in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh; seven in Jharkhand; 13 in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. No action has been taken against the police in any of these cases. As for relief, very little, delayed or none at all has been provided to the deceased farmersÃ¢ÂÂ families. So, there is disquiet in the farmlands of India, which still engages more than 6 out of 10 working people and feeds 7 out of every 10 Indians. So, the agrarian crisis is bound to be a major issue in the ensuing national elections of 2019 in India. The farming community would this time demand very solid measures in the interest of their survival if any party solicits their support.
There is a major difference of opinion among different schools of thought with regards to who should be called farmers with many not including tribals or milk and poultry producers etc. In fact, the conglomerate of farmers should include all producers of primary agricultural commodities, including women, Dalit, nomadic and adivasi farmers; also landowners, tenants, sha-recroppers, agricultural labourers and plantation workers; fishing folk, milk producers, poultry farmers, livestock rearers, pastoralists, and collectors of MFP (Minor Forest Produce); and, finally, everyone engaged in crop cultivation, shifting cultivation, apiculture, sericulture, vermiculture, and agro-forestry.
This broad scope of agrarian community makes it around 62 per cent of the Indian society and, hence, the well-being of farmers is not just about economic survival of a majority of Indian households, it is about retaining our national dignity and IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs civilisational heritage. There has been an unprecedented increase in diversion and destruction of agricultural land, privatisation of water, forced displacement, deprivation and migration affecting security of food and livelihood. We find a persistent state of neglect of agriculture and discrimination against farming communities and an increasing vulnerability of farmers to extortion by the village powerful and government officials.
Also, alongside, there is a deepening penetration of large, predatory and profiteering corporations that are already in control of significant areas of Indian agriculture. All these have led to a spate of farmer suicides across the country and unbearable burden of indebtedness. Before the next general elections, farmers demand holding of a special session to address the agrarian crisis by passing and enacting the two Kisan Mukti Bills, namely, FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Freedom from Indebtedness Bill, 2018; and the FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Right to Guaranteed Remunerative Minimum Support Prices for Agricultural Commodities Bill, 2018. Beyond this, the agrarian agenda needs to be at the top of the manifesto of those who want to govern India from 2019 after the next general elections in the first half of the year.
An important issue for the next government is to stop land acquisition or land pooling without informed consent of the farmers, halt acquisition or diversion of agricultural land for commercial land development or for creation of land banks and prevent the bypassing or dilution of The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 at the state level, and instead need to evolve land use and agricultural land protection policy at the earliest. To solve the challenges specifically of the sugarcane farmers, the government ahead needs to mandate that the sugar mills to pay interest at 15 per cent pa if cane dues are not paid to the cane-growers within 14 days of the delivery of cane; and Fixed Rate Price (FRP) of cane to be fixed by linking it to 9.5 per cent recovery of sugar.
The new government needs to ensure three levels of action for the farmers: first, protect the farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming by reviewing the Contract Farming Act 2018; and, second, promote procurement, processing and marketing under Farmer Producer Organisations and Peasant Cooperatives instead of corporatisation of agriculture and takeover by MNCs. The thid level of action should be to promote an agro-ecology paradigm that is based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival, so as to build economically viable, ecologically sustainable, autonomous and climate resilient agriculture. The agrarian agenda is the most important agenda for impoverished India today and it is staring on the face of the nation whether India goes ahead with a caring governance and policy-making on these issues.

According to a spokesperson for the now-revised six-lane expessway project, Arul was at a photocopy centre outside the office of the special tahsildar of Cheyyar, where the farmers had come to hand over their petitions against the project. He was photocopying petitions while others were recording videos on their phones of farmers arriving at the premises with their petitions. They were picked up and taken to the Cheyyar police station without any explanation.

The summons were issued pursuant to objections raised by the farmers earlier under the National Highways Act 48/1956 under Section 3 A (1).

Mumbai: Thousands of farmers and tribals began a two-day march from Thane to Mumbai on Wednesday, eight months after a similar protest that started from Nashik.
The farmers are demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report, which suggested that farmers must have assured access and control over resources such as land and water. They are also demanding an increase in the Minimum Support Price and a judicial system to ensure its implementation.
The farmers, struggling to cope with the agrarian crisis, are demanding proper implementation of the loan waiver package announced by the BJP-led government in the state last year, land rights for farmers and compensation for farm labourers.
They are also demanding drought compensation of Rs 50,000 per acre for non-irrigated land and Rs 1 lakh per acre for irrigated land and other issues.and the transfer of forest rights to tribals.
Magsaysay award winner Dr Rajendra Singh, also known as Waterman of India, is among the marchers. The Aam Aadmi Party in Maharashtra has also extended support to the agitating farmers.
Farmers started walking Wednesday afternoon and will reach the Somaiyya Ground in Mumbai's Sion area where they will halt for the night.
The farmers will reach Azad Maidan in south Mumbai early on Thursday and will try to hold a demonstration near Vidhan Bhawan, where the state legislature session is underway, a leader of the march said. The participants are mostly from Thane, Bhusawal and Marathwada regions, he said.
Ã¢ÂÂWe have been consistently asking the state government to fulfil our long-standing demands but the response has been lukewarm. We are forced to launch this agitation,""Ã¢ÂÂsaid Pratibha Shinde, general secretary of Lok Sangharsh Morcha, which is organising the protest.

Ã¢ÂÂThere is no such proposal in the works,Ã¢ÂÂ an official told Moneycontrol adding that the requirement to acquire 80 percent land for build-operate-transfer (BOT) and 90 percent land for engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) mode stands intact.
The official refuted media reports doing the round that union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, could put forward a policy relaxing the rule.
The report said that Gadkari could give his final nod to the proposal of reducing mandatory land acquisition from 80 present to 50 percent.
Ã¢ÂÂThe minister is very strict regarding highway projectsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Easing the land acquisition rule is completely against his stand,Ã¢ÂÂ another official added.
Many projects were stuck in the past due to failure of the government to acquire land, hence such a proposal is uncalled for, the official added.

While maintaining that progress on highwaysÃ¢ÂÂ project has picked up pace in states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, Gadkari said that work in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal remained a concern.
Ã¢ÂÂLand acquisition, utility shifting and forest clearance continue to mar the progress in the sector,Ã¢ÂÂ he had said.
Interestingly Eastern Peripheral Expressway, CentreÃ¢ÂÂs recent Ã¢ÂÂengineering-marvelÃ¢ÂÂ which was constructed in about 500 days and was inaugurated in May this year, was delayed by over 10 years due to land acquisition.
Supreme Court had ordered in 2006 to construct a ring-road, bypassing the national capital, to solve its traffic and pollution woes. The project, however, was delayed as farmers (especially in Noida and Greater Noida) didnÃ¢ÂÂt agree to surrender their land against the remuneration being offered.

In India, tens of thousands of farmers have marched to the parliament in the capital, Delhi, to highlight the deepening agrarian crisis.
Protesters from across the country gathered in capital and held a rally demanding better crop prices, drought relief and loan waivers.

116,798,positive,"The Indian pulp and paper industry has agro forestry roots and strong backward linkages with the farming community, from whom wood, which is a key raw material, is sourced. India is a wood fibre deficient country. Inadequate raw material availability in the country is a major constraint for the domestic paper industry which impacts its cost competitiveness.

Over the last two decades State Forest Development Corporations (FDCs) and the industry worked with farmers to create a sustained wood resource base of more than three million hectares of plantations, under agro / farm forestry. About 70 per cent of these plantations is eucalyptus.

Higher productivity

Industry and FDCs invested in genetic improvement and development of highly productive and disease-resistant clones which quadrupled plantation productivity making it viable for farmers in terms of competitive land use.

Multiplication of clonal plants to raise eucalyptus agro/farm forestry plantation, is done with root trainer technology, which promotes lateral root system to enable root system to go only up to 1.5-2.0 metre soil depth. Every year around 150,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantation is raised creating around 70 million man-days of employment in rural areas.

A Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Report (The Puzzle of Forest Productivity, 2017), says eucalyptus plantation yields more net income annually to farmers than almost 60- 70 per cent of agriculture crops. Eucalyptus plantation water use has been found to be 785 litres/kg of total biomass, which is one of the lowest if compared with tree species such as Acacia (1,323 litres/kg), Dalbergia (1,484 litres/kg) and agricultural crops such as paddy rice (2,000 litres/kg) and cotton (3,200 litres/kg).

Ground water & eucalyptus

In February 2017, the Karnataka government banned growing of eucalyptus plantations in private land in the State. Similar move has been started in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. These actions would have severe social, economic, industrial and environmental consequences and would also go against the objectives of National Forest Policy, 1988 as well as National Agroforestry Policy, 2014.

Based on the presentation of the studies and facts by the Indian Paper Manufactures Association (IPMA), the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change wrote to the Karnataka government asking it to reconsider its decision stating: Ã¢ÂÂIt is a well established fact that eucalyptus is an important tree species for agro forestry and farm forestry and is contributing as a raw material for pulp, plywood and fuel wood, besides giving good economic returns to farmers and tree growers and is also improving tree cover in the country. There are some concerns that eucalyptus depletes the ground water levels. However, there are no concrete studies to conclusively establish ill-effects of plantation of eucalyptus.Ã¢ÂÂ

In fact, many studies have pointed out that eucalyptus plantations do not absorb ground water and have no adverse impact on the water table. In a case before it, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in its order dated July 20, 2015, stated that based on studies in different countries eucalyptus, one of the major farm forestry species, has no adverse environmental impact nor is it disastrous for water table, as it consumes less water per kg of total biomass generated versus many tree and agricultural crops. Also, eucalyptus is not a water-intensive species and does not drain waterlogged areas, as indicated by plantations raised in such areas in Uttar Pradesh.

Dinesh Kumar, a well-known scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, in his paper Ã¢ÂÂPlace of Eucalyptus in Indian Agroforestry SystemsÃ¢ÂÂ in a book on Ã¢ÂÂEucalyptus in India: Past, Present and FutureÃ¢ÂÂ (1986), highlights that eucalyptus are adapted to life in a dry or physiologically dry habitat have a low transpiration rate to prevent water loss. A report published by Vinayakrao Patil, titled Ã¢ÂÂLocal Communities and Eucalyptus - An Experience in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂ (1995), mentions that (a) eucalyptus does not compete for ground water and other nutrients with crops in its vicinity; (b) eucalyptus does not need plenty of water and does not drain away subsoil water; (c) eucalyptus does not cause degradation of land and does not hamper soil fertility.

It is, therefore, critical that eucalyptus plantations are raised, given its significant impact on wood availability, livelihood generation and carbon sequestration that addresses the challenges of global warming and climate change. It would be important to note that eucalyptus plantations under the agro/farm forestry programmes are not water guzzlers as is wrongly perceived by some.

As part of this drive, the BMC squad caught seven stray dogs Friday and two days earlier it seized four stray cows.

Two days ago, the local airport authority had urged the civic body to make the vicinity of the airport free from stray animals and birds that are always posing threat to aircraft operations. Considering the seriousness of the matter, the BMC has immediately launched a special drive.

It is common practice for cow owners to let their cattle loose near the airport to graze. Such practice poses danger to aircraft movements as the animals can inadvertently move towards the operation area. BMC Deputy Commissioner of Enforcement Abani Pattnaik admitted that cattle grazers are taking their animals wilfully to the area close to the airport and such practice is illegal.

To address the problem, the BMC, apart from forming squads to catch stray cattle, is going to prepare a list of people who are keeping cows in the surrounding areas of the airport. They will be under the BMC scanner. If they are found to be sending their cows to the nearby airport areas for grazing, action would be taken against them.

Besides stray animals, birds hovering around the airport area is another serious problem for both the civic body and the airport authority.

The problem is ascribed to several meat and fish shops near the airport areas which attract birds. In recent past, non-veg vendors were evicted from the locality. But the problem is continuing. Ã¢ÂÂThese vendors are habitual offenders. They return to their business some days after eviction drive,Ã¢ÂÂ locals alleged.

And to get the airport areas free from these fish and meat vendors, BMC has formed a team of environmental engineers from its Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) cell. The cell is keeping a tab on environment impact analysis at the airport area in relation to sanitation and solid waste management. The team of officials pays regular visits and submit reports on the solid waste management status, selling of meat or fish illegally in the airport area.

While the drive against stray cattle and dogs shall continue for a few more days, the eviction drive against the illegal fish and meat vendors would be made more frequent, a BMC official said.

Although the government conceded into some of their demands in the evening, the farmers refused to budge as their main demands were not met.
Thousands of farmers protested as part of the Kisan Kranti Padyatra demanding loan waiver, subsidised electricity and fuel, pension for farmers above 60 and implementation of the MSP as per the production cost approved by the Swaminathan Commission. The contentious issue is what is the production cost that a farmer incurs and how can the minimum support price be 50% more than it. Mandarins have obfuscated the production cost in such a manner that the farmer rarely makes money on MSP.
The government also did not commit to the demand for a complete loan waiver and pondering over few others, the farmers said that they would continue with their protest. Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Naresh Tikait said that they were ""unsatisfied"" and would continue the agitation till all their demands are met. ""Farmers have not been able to repay their loans because of drought, crop failure, floods, low MSP and various other reasons,"" said Naresh Tikait, son of Mahender Singh Tikait one of tallest farmer leaders, who died in 2011.
Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Shekhawat said that the government will ensure that crops are purchased from farmers. ""We will incorporate farmers' suggestions as far as crop insurance is concerned,"" Shekhawat said. He added the decision on the fixation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) based on 'C2' input factor as per the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations will also be done in future. ""The Centre will send an advisory on the minimum amount fixed for a particular harvest so that every farmer gets a right price for his/her crop,"" he said.
VM Singh, convenor of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan and the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella of 201 organisations said, ""The government has not met our demands, this was a trailer today. Now, farmers from across the country will converge again in full force on Nov 29 in Delhi to press for complete loan waiver and MSP based on Swaminathan formula of production cost.""
The government has formed a committee of six chief ministers to look into the issue of labour for farm. ""The committee is in talks to link MNREGA with agriculture,"" Shekhawat said. He added that the Centre would move court over the NGT order (to ban tractor and vehicles which are more than 10 years old).
He said that it would also forward the demand of reducing GST on agricultural equipment to 5% to the GST Council at the earliest.
The farmers who had come marching from Haridwar laid seize to Gazipur blocking most part of two national highways. The farmers parked their tractors and trolleys in Gazipur, making it out of bounds for everyone. At least seven farmers and one ACP were injured in the violence. The police has imposed prohibitory orders for a week, anticipating law and order situation.
The Kisan Kranti March was started by BKU chieftain Tikait at Haridwar on September 23. Thousands of farmers joined the protest and descended at Kisan Ghat. They were, however, stopped at the border by Delhi police. The police resorted to lathicharge, water cannon and tear gas when the farmers tried to break the security blockades and gain access into Delhi.
Sources have claimed that the violence took place when senior BKU leaders had gone to meet Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Naresh, however, did not accompany the delegation. Sources further said that he was neither present at the protest spot, adding that Singh spoke to him over the phone.
By evening, the government had agreed to some of the demands made by the farmers, which Tikait claimed was unacceptable. ""The farmers will not retreat from the spot till all our demands are met,"" he said. Yudhir Singh, spokesperson of BKU tweeted that they had a discussion on 11 points with the government. ""The government has agreed on seven points but didn't agree on four points,"" he said in the tweet.

121,824,positive,"Accusing the State government of being a failure in taking action on the report of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed into the alleged land scams including encroachments, tampering of revenue records and other irregularities, former Minister Dadi Veerabhadra Rao has demanded that the report be put in the public domain.

Voicing the fears of people pertaining to encroachments of private land too, he wanted an IAS officer to be appointed exclusively to prevent encroachments, inquire into pending complaints, undertake field survey of government, endowment and waqf land.

Ã¢ÂÂOfficials involvedÃ¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThe SIT probed into only 344 complaints and 2,531 more are still pending with the CollectorÃ¢ÂÂs office. The SIT report has been gathering dust in the Secretariat for more than eight months and same is the fate of the 12 trunk-loads of documents submitted to SIT in the District Treasury office,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Veerabhadra Rao told the media here.

He pointed out that the DGP, who was the Chairman of the SIT, had said that 32 private persons, political leaders in power now and in the past and 30 government officials were involved in the various irregularities. In 101 cases, departmental inquiries were recommended.

He also made it clear that many of the NoCs issued to ex-servicemenÃ¢ÂÂs lands were bogus and 300 acres at Madhurawada worth Ã¢ÂÂ¹3,000 crore was mirred in several lapses, the former Minister claimed.

Ã¢ÂÂThe TDP government is turning clod shoulders towards the ground realities and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu does not seem to be interested in any district, but Amaravati. I am at a loss to understand what prevents him from making the SIT report public,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Dadi Veerabhadra Rao said.

It is clear that the peopleÃ¢ÂÂ s representatives were involved in the land scam and not making the SIT report public is giving a scope for doubts as to whether the Chief Minister was afraid or trying to protect his party-men, he said.

Even as people are worried about their properties, he alleged, the family members of the ruling party leaders were camping in five-star hotels and sending brokers to lawyers offering to resolve land issues.

Ã¢ÂÂRampant corruptionÃ¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂUnder the TDP dispensation, corruption has become the order of the day at government offices. Land acquisition turned out into a bonanza,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Veerabhadra Rao said. For assigned lands only a part of the compensation was given to farmers and the rest was being recorded in somebody elseÃ¢ÂÂs name. On the top of it, officials allegedly involved in irregularities were given postings in mandals with valuable lands, he alleged.

Land pooling scheme

Referring to the land pooling scheme, the former minister said it was a big scam as there was no sanctity to the implementation of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, he said, adding that assigned land was being taken through urban development authority for layouts.Soon meetings with former MLAs and other leaders would be organised to plan protests, he added.",Dadi questions governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂinactionÃ¢ÂÂ on Vizag land scam
122,831,positive,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday said that his government has banned bauxite mining in the Araku Valley area after coming to power and the Maoists are using mining as a pretext for killing TDP legislator Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Somu.
Naidu visited the Araku Valley on Friday after returning from New York. From Visakhapatnam, Naidu went to Paderu where he reached out to Kidari's family.
Naidu announced Rs 1 crore assistance to the family and government job to KidariÃ¢ÂÂs second son. Ã¢ÂÂWe will politically take care of KidariÃ¢ÂÂs first son. It is a misnomer that the TDP government has encouraged bauxite mining that led to the killings. It was Y S Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR) who opened the Valley for bauxite mining,Ã¢ÂÂ Naidu said.
He said the government is facing cases in international courts for cancelling the leases given during the YSR regime. Ã¢ÂÂDespite that, we have said a big no to mining as it would destroy the livelihood of the tribal community,Ã¢ÂÂ Naidu said.
He condemned the brutal and cold-blooded murder of two tribal leaders. Ã¢ÂÂGenuine leadership in tribal areas is hard to find. After years of toil, only one becomes a leader and what message are the Maoists giving by killing such young leaders?Ã¢ÂÂ Naidu asked.
He later visited Siveri Soma's residence in Araku. Naidu declared Rs 15 lakh assistance (Rs 10 lakh from government and Rs 5 lakh from TDP) to each of the seven members of the former TDP MLAÃ¢ÂÂs family. He also offered a government job to SiveriÃ¢ÂÂs second son and a plot in Visakhapatnam. Naidu pointed out that none of the two slain leaders had own houses, indicating that they are not corrupt as alleged by the Maoists.
Director General of Police R P Thakur, who visited the spot where the TDP leaders were killed by the Maoists on Wednesday, attributed the incident to Intelligence failure arising out of lack of coordination between Greyhounds and other wings of the Police Department.
Ã¢ÂÂWe take the responsibility for the incident and assure the public that we will fight back against the Maoists,Ã¢ÂÂ Thakur told reporters.

Leopard
After news of the sighting of a leopard near a factory at Taloja, Navi Mumbai, on November 20, forest department officials have been desperately searching for the wild cat. Around 40 officials have been roaming the 18-acre area on foot and are also using a drone in their search. A few NGOs, too, have joined the search, forest department officials said.
According to the officials, they have found pug marks of the leopard in the Taloja MIDC area. The sighting of the leopard in the area had raised eyebrows of those living in the area. Many villagers have insisted that the news of the sighting was only a rumour as there has been no history of leopard sightings or presence in the area. In the footage that has gone viral, the leopard can be clearly seen strolling about on the premises of the factory.
Forest department officials feel that the leopard could have strayed into the area from the Karnala bird sanctuary. Panvel range forest official D Sonawane said, ""After we learnt about the leopard sighting, we went to the spot and conducted an extensive search in the area. We did find the animal's pug marks there. The very next day, we formed four teams of 10 people each and roped in some members of animal NGOs to search for the leopard. The area that the animal can roam in is around 18 acres and our teams went to every corner of the property but could not find it.""
He added, ""We have now decided to search for the leopard with the help of a drone. We haven't seen any activity by it so far, but we have to be alert if he is still around the area. For the next few days we will keep a sharp eye out for it. The leopard must have come from the Matheran hills.""

126,840,positive,"Panaji: Taking on critics of his controversial letter to Karnataka BJP leader B.S. Yeddyurappa over the Mhadei river interstate dispute, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday said it is inevitable for Karnataka to get its share of the river water.

He added that those who think otherwise were living in a fool's paradise.

While addressing a press conference at the State Secretariat in Panaji, Parrikar also said that Goa's main contention at the ongoing Mhadei Water disputes Tribunal was that Karnataka could not divert water from the already-deficit Mhadei basin to the Malaprabha river basin, which was against law.

""If someone thinks that water cannot be taken by Karnataka, he is living in a fool's paradise. He doesn't understand law. (If) a river flows through Karnataka, how can you deny water to them? But they cannot take the water to some other area. They have to drink it or they have to use it in that area,"" Parrikar told reporters.

Mhadei, also known as the Mandovi river, is termed as a lifeline in the northern parts of Goa. It originates in Karnataka and meets the Arabian Sea at Panaji in Goa, while briefly flowing through the territory of Maharashtra. While the river runs 28.8 km in Karnataka, it is 52 km in length in the state Goa.

The southern state has demanded that Goa should allow the transfer of over seven TMC water to the Malaprabha river basin to tide over its irrigation and drinking water needs.

In its case presented before the Tribunal, Parrikar said that the Goa government, along with documentary evidence, had argued that nearly 115 TMC (thousand million cubic-feet) water was available in the Mhadei basin, whereas the actual requirement of water in the basin in all three states, namely Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa is about 145 TMC.

""The river basin is negative on requirement. Therefore, water cannot be drawn from the river and taken to some other river. That is the point before the Tribunal,"" Parrikar said.

Responding to criticism of his letter written in December to Yeddyurappa, where Parrikar had agreed ""on humanitarian grounds"" to consider the southern state's demand for drinking water in North Karnataka, the Goa Chief Minister said that the critics were misinformed and that his letter had taken into account the interests of Goa.

""If you (critics) try to speculate out of my letter, that is not my concern. I am sorry. I am very clear about this, that I have written a perfectly valid letter in the interest of the State,"" Parrikar said, while accusing the media of wrongly slandering him and the Goa government.

Parrikar's letter has now triggered a divide in the state cabinet and has also resulted in protests across Karnataka, with Congress and BJP criticising each other for being unable to resolve the stand-off.

In his own cabinet, Parrikar now faces opposition, with Fisheries Minister Vinod Palienkar, who belongs to Goa Forward, a regional party, vehemently opposing Parrikar's offer in the letter to Yeddyurappa.

Another ruling ally, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party has also demanded a status quo on the dispute with Karnataka.

Asked to respond to an assurance given by Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister H.N. Ananth Kumar, who while responding to a Zero Hour notice raised by Karnataka MP S.P. Muddahanumegowda, that Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has already written to Yeddyurappa for outside negotiations to resolve the matter, Parrikar said: ""Have I made a statement? If they bait each other what do I do? I am not responsible for demands someone else makes. I explained my stand to you clearly time and again.""

As the ultimate man-animal conflict drama plays out in Yavatmal, complete with a notorious shooter, an expert team of 60, and guiding elephants, locals struggle with anger, grief and loss of livelihood

Pandharkawada:

On August 4, 60-year-old Gulab Mokashe, a resident of Wedshi village, left in the morning along with his 55-year-old brother Nathu Mokashe and cattle from the village to the hilly areas surrounding the village's farms to graze in the shrubs. It was a regular day and, with an errand back in the village, the brother returned home at 6 pm.

The sun was on its way down by 6.30 pm and Gulab was expected back. It would have been a regular day had it not been for the fact that Gulab didn't return home, prompting Nathu, at 8 pm, to walk to the local sarpanch's home to raise an alarm. Ankush Muneshwar, the village's 53-year-old sarpanch says that it was raining heavily that night and so, hoping that Gulab was delayed while taking shelter from the rain, they waited till 9.30 pm. And when that didn't happen, they called the forest department, which reached the village immediately. Night had fallen hard and it was too late to launch a search operation.

That evening when he didnÃ¢ÂÂt return, locals launched a search and found his body a mere 200m from the village. T1 was spotted nearby. Pics/Shadab Khan

At 4 am, a team from the forest department accompanied by Nathu and 20 others from the village, including Muneshwar, set out on the two-hour climb to the top of the hill. The scene they encountered would be too gory to spell out in detail. Gulab's body, visibly eaten, had been left to the elements. It was the first of three killings in August by tigress T1 that launched a 60-person manhunt with human and elephant resources being called in from across not just Maharashtra, but also Madhya Pradesh to trap the nearly 170-kg threat. By the end of the month, T1 would have taken a total of 13 human lives since July 2016.

Each morning, Deputy Conservator of Forest MK Abharna discusses the plan of action. Every team comes back to her with updates at regular intervals. ""Around 6 am, the two elephants followed by our foot-patrolling team visits the forest looking for pugmarks. The camera trap teams also check the cameras based on which we plan our day. The expert team from MP, along with vets are already there,"" she says

Yavatmal district lies on the eastern fringes of Maharashtra, a good 700 km from Mumbai. And Wedshi lies on the boundary of the Pandharkawada (a fragmented forest) along with others such as Ralegaon, Kelapur, Sarati and Pandarkawada. For the last two years, the residents of these villages have been haunted by a now five-year-old tigress named T1 who moved from the nearby Tipeshwar Wildlife sanctuary, around 70 km from what's now being called a conflict zone, as a two-year-old. Not much is known about her. It is speculated that her mother pushed her out and, in search for a territory of her own, she moved to Pandharkawada where she now roams with two 10-month-old cubs. Officials fear she might be teaching the cubs to hunt and this might make them less fearful of humans too.

MK Abharna

There's a tiger in the forest as well, but he isn't the problem at hand. The manhunt for the tigeress would have begun in January 2018, had the forest department had enough evidence at hand to prove that it was indeed T1 that had led to loss of human lives. Then the Principal Chief Conservator Of Forest, also the chief wildlife warden of the state, AK Mishra had issued orders after T1 claimed a resident of Loni village on January 27. However, at the time a Nagpur-based activist Dr Jerryl Banait approached the Bombay High Court pleading against the action as the officials had no evidence to pursue their case. That came with Gulab.

The tigress, having eaten 60 per cent of his body, had left enough of her DNA around the kill area - which also matched with five other kill sites - and camera trap images confirming her presence in the forest. That she had eaten a human helped classify her as a man-eater. But, that would still not move things quickly enough. It took the loss of two more lives to get a final Supreme Court nod - the HC order was challenged in court by Dr Banait and Sarita Subramaniam from the Mumbai-based Earth Brigade Foundation - saying human life is important as well.

Pravin Waghuji Raut, 12, and Ganesh Waghuji Raut, 14, are the sons of Waghuji Raut, 60, T1's second victim in August from Vihirgaon village. The only bread winner in their family is their mother Renuka, 39

At the basecamp outside Pandharkawada forest, near Sarati village, are 10 tents that are currently serving as the safe space for the 60-member team that the forest department has out together to catch T1. There's the ground staff, a patrolling team, members of the state's Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) four vets from Madhya Pradesh who will hopefully tranquilise T1 when they find her (see box: Protocol to hunt a man-eater) and members from various NGOS from the state that have put up 80 camera traps inside the thicket and rush every morning at 6 am in the hope of finding T1's location. They return by 9.30 am with data from the 70 sq km area, which T1 now occupies.

On the basis of her activity, they plan the course of action of the hunt that will continue till the afternoon heat makes it impossible for the human beings and the four elephants they have hired to help them walk through the talk and dense foliage of the lantana plant. With the bushes running as high as 14 feet, thanks to the monsoon, humans can't make their way on foot. It's not easy with elephants, but it's the best option available considering the absence of roads and the possibility that T1 could easily hide anywhere, invisible to those hunting her.

An official, not willing to be identified, says, ""She's a very clever and elusive tigress who is not just avoiding trap cages, but our teams as well. The terrain is replete with ravines and gorges and so it becomes difficult to reach every nook and cranny.""

But, if the humans huddled together at the base camp, armed with their tranquilisers and guns, are wary of T1, it's the villagers' wrath that they are downright afraid of.

The fragmented forest of Pandharkawada is near the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary from where it is believed that T1 walked as a young two-year-old

And it was the 13th kill on August 28 that brought the message home: Patience lasts only so long. Nagorav Junghare of Pimpleshende village, 20 km from Wedshi, had taken his cattle to graze on his farm. The farm borders the forest, but the cattle remained on his farm. After lunch, he went to the stream that cuts through his land for a sip of water. It was the last time he was seen.

At 6 pm, two of his cows, as was their routine, returned home, without Junghare. A local villager Gajanan Panchbudhe went to the farm, along with others to look for him. At the stream, they found Junghare's body, half eaten and discarded by T1. The kill, they believe, must have happened in the afternoon around 2 pm or 3 pm. After all, tigers, unlike leopards, are neither nocturnal nor have any specific times one can watch out for.

The forest department has now assembled a team of 60 that have set up base camp outside the forest from where they enter the forest, set up camera traps and check for pug marks to find T1

It took a usually prompt forest department an hour to arrive at the spot. When they did, two vehicles were damaged by the angry mob of 60 villagers. It was again up to the local honorary wildlife warden Ramzan Virani to calm the villagers down. He had done this a little over a fortnight ago, at Vihirgaon, when a mob of 200 had gathered after Waghuji Raut, a grazer from their village, became another victim.

For the last two years, Virani has been the forest department's on-ground 'fire fighter', soothing angry nerves, visiting villages so that the human-predator conflict doesn't take an ugly turn.

Wedshi's sarpanch Ankush Muneshwar says the forest department should have acted sooner. The thick foliage in the forest during the monsoons has reduced chances of tranqulising the tigress. Visibility would have been much higher in the summer

His awareness pitches have been to ask the villagers not to enter the protected areas in the forest, where they often take their cattle for grazing, and instead stick to the fringes. ""If your cattle graze away, take help of the forest department and other villagers when entering the forest,"" he says. The forest department has deployed two private van mazdoors to act as body guards for the villagers when entering the forest is unavoidable. Of course, their help isn't always taken. At Pimpleshende, Virani pleaded to the villagers to let the forest department do its job. After all, if the officials didn't take hold of the body, collect samples for DNA testing, how could it prove that a life had been lost to a tigress? How would the bereaved family get a compensation of Rs 10 lakh?

Graphic/Uday Mohite

Talk of money may seem crass when 13 lives have been lost, but T1's menacing presence has hurt the villagers of Yavatmal where it hurts the most - livelihood. The farms here subsist on cotton, soybean and toor and harvest season is around the corner. For the last four days, says Wedshi villager Raghuji, farmers haven't tended to their lands as the forest department has asked them to stay away. ""We are economically dependant on farming. If we continue to stay away from the farms, our crops will be destroyed thanks to herbivores like wild boar and neelgai who will raid the crops,"" says Muneshwar. Here, even the 400 cattle haven't been sent grazing in days, and without much fodder at home, they've begun starving too. There's no sign of activity in the village. Humans are huddled in corners awaiting only one news: T1 has been caught.

Protocol to hunt a man-eater

If an animal is classified either a human killer or man-eater, the priority is to find it, tranquilise it and keep it in a zoo. If tranquilising isn't possible, only then can a call to shoot be taken.

128,849,positive,"New Delhi, INDIA - June 4, 2018 /3BL Media/ -- A new report released today offers a ground-breaking platform to evaluate the real costs and benefitsÃ¢ÂÂincluding environmental, health, and social impactsÃ¢ÂÂof our agriculture and food systems. This Scientific and Economic Foundations Report provides the basis for a major paradigm shift in how we view and manage our agriculture and food systems, demonstrating how to evaluate not just the visible but also the hidden costs and benefits. The timing is criticalÃ¢ÂÂwith 10 billion people to feed by 2050 and 40 percent of available land already growing foodÃ¢ÂÂwe need to consider new frameworks and models for how we grow, process, distribute, and consume food, and manage food waste.

The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), known for its ground-breaking research on the economic values of nature in 2010, brings together more than 150 experts from 33 countries to deliver a strong and urgent message to the global community on the need for a transformation of our agriculture and food systems that is sustainable, equitable, and healthy. With this report, policymakers, researchers, and citizens now have more reliable and integrated information on the hidden (and unaccounted) costs and benefitsÃ¢ÂÂthe Ã¢ÂÂexternalitiesÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂof the whole system, not just parts of it.

Agricultural productivity is typically measured by yield per hectare, a simplistic metric that provides an incomplete picture of the true costs and benefits associated with agriculture and food value chains. Current patterns of production, processing, and consumption are generating large and unacceptable impacts on the health of the environment and humans, particularly on vulnerable populations. For example, take the cost of a tomato at a supermarket. The cost does not take into account how it was raised, such as the environmental damage from fertilizer and pesticide runoff, the regeneration of soil, or a fair wage payment to laborers. Applying the TEEBAgriFood framework shows that cheap food can be very expensive when we shine a light on all its hidden costs to our health, livelihoods, soils, water and climate.

The TEEB for Agriculture & Food (TEEBAgriFood) Scientific and Economic Foundations report, a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) project, funded by the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, is looking at all the impacts of the value chain, from farm to fork to disposal, including effects on livelihoods, the environment, and health. This framework can help tackle the challenges currently faced by our global agriculture and food systems in achieving universal food security and reducing large impacts on climate, ecosystems, and environments.

Ã¢ÂÂIf we want to bend the curve on biodiversity loss we must understand the true impacts of the food system on our planet,Ã¢ÂÂ says Joao Campari, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Food Practice Leader. Ã¢ÂÂWWF works across the full spectrum of the food system, from production to consumption, loss and waste, and we welcome TEEBAgriFoodÃ¢ÂÂs research as it assesses a multitude of impacts on both people and planet, instead of trying to distill the complexities into one over-simplified metric. We look forward to seeing the evaluation framework be applied to real-world projects and hopefully contributing to transformational change.""

Some of the consequences of our current systems outlined in the report include:

Agricultural production contributes over one-fourth of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).

When considering land-use change and deforestation as well as processing, packaging,

transport, sale, and the waste of agricultural products, 43 to 57 percent of GHG emissions

are from food production.

70 to 90 percent of global deforestation is from agricultural expansion.

An estimated 80 percent of food consumed in food-insecure regions is grown there, mainly

by women, while agri-business is a marginal player in food security.

According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, if women had the same access to

resources (land, credits, education, etc.) as male farmers, they could raise yields by 20 to 30 percent and lift as many as 150 million people out of hunger.

Approximately one-third of the food produced in the world for human consumption everyyear gets lost or wasted, enough to feed the worldÃ¢ÂÂs hungry six times over.

Around 40 percent of available land is used for growing food, a figure that would need to rise to an improbable 70 percent by 2050 under a Ã¢ÂÂbusiness-as-usualÃ¢ÂÂ scenario.

33 percent of the EarthÃ¢ÂÂs land surface is moderately to highly affected by some type of soil degradation mainly due to the erosion, salinization, compaction, acidification, or chemical pollution of soils.

Six of the top eleven risk factors driving the global burden of disease are diet-related.

The World Health Organization estimates the direct costs of diabetes at more than US$827

billion per year, globally.

Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemical substances causes

more than 200 diseases, and an estimated 600 million peopleÃ¢ÂÂalmost 1 in 10 people in the

worldÃ¢ÂÂfall ill after eating contaminated food, while 420,000 die every year.

61 percent of commercial fish populations are fully fished and 29 percent are overfished.

In a Ã¢ÂÂbusiness-as-usualÃ¢ÂÂ scenario, the ocean will contain more plastic than fish (by weight) by 2050.

In order to demonstrate how real-world applications of such a comprehensive approach might take shape, a framework for evaluation has been developed to provide a solid basis from an economic and accounting perspective. The report also identifies theories and pathways for transformational change in government, business, farming, and consumer contexts.

Ã¢ÂÂThe overarching importance of this work is that we must link the health of people with the health of the planet, and we can only ensure long-term food security if our food systems donÃ¢ÂÂt destroy the basis of food production,Ã¢ÂÂ says Alexander MuÃÂller, Study Leader of TEEBAgriFood. Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at food production only from a price perspective, and the old paradigm of the cheaper the better, you run into a trap because the long-term sustainability of our food production system is not a given and requires hard work.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWe are trying to pull together the latest scientific results on food systems,Ã¢ÂÂ says MuÃÂller. Ã¢ÂÂWe tried to link together the latest findings of economists, environmentalists, agriculturalists, people looking at labor and trade, and science to fight poverty. If you bring these results together in a new way, you can see that the system is more than all the different parts of the disciplinary sciences working on it.Ã¢ÂÂ

To ensure the sustainability of agriculture and food systems, an important step is to account for externalities through market mechanisms. By creating a more comprehensive evaluation framework, decisionmakers can better compare different policies, programs, and strategies, while the market can more accurately value food. TEEBAgriFood hopes their new framework will help achieve their vision of a world where informed decisionmaking upholds public good and ensures nutrition and health for all humans so they can live in harmony with nature.

Ã¢ÂÂOur framework provides a holistic, ethical, wide-angle lens with which to really understand ourfood systems today,Ã¢ÂÂ says Pavan Sukhdev, member of the TEEBAgriFood Steering Committeeand Founder-CEO of GIST Advisory. Ã¢ÂÂBecause of its holistic approach, this framework is not aseasy to apply as a single-lens approachÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂper hectare productivity,Ã¢ÂÂ for exampleÃ¢ÂÂbut it is ethically, socially, economically, and environmentally much more appropriate, and can provide sustainable business models in the context of climate change, changing global demographics, local economies, and health. I want decisionmakers in governments and businesses to realize that they should support the use of this wide-angle lens applied to the full eco-agri-food system instead of the inadequate narrow lens of per-hectare productivity in farms.Ã¢ÂÂ

About TEEBAgriFood: Lead by the U.N. Environment Programme, the TEEBAgriFood initiative brings together scientists, economists, policymakers, business leaders, and farmersÃ¢ÂÂ organizations in order to agree how to frame, undertake, and use holistic evaluations of agricultural systems, practices, products, and policy scenarios against a comprehensive range of impacts and dependencies across food value chains. It makes and illustrates the case for Ã¢ÂÂsystems thinkingÃ¢ÂÂ instead of Ã¢ÂÂsilo thinking.Ã¢ÂÂ TEEBAgriFood provides a comprehensive economic evaluation of the Ã¢ÂÂeco-agri-food systemsÃ¢ÂÂ complex, and demonstrates that the economic environment in which farmers operate is distorted by significant externalities, both negative and positive, and a lack of awareness of dependency on natural, human, and social capital.

129,856,positive,"IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs booming population and rapidly expanding urban areas have exacted a huge toll on its rivers, which are badly polluted and choked by development. But in cities across India, activists are heading to court to force municipalities and states to take action.

Standing on a small concrete bridge, environmental activist Janak Daftary gestures toward the crowded banks of the Mithi River, which runs through the heart of Mumbai. On one side are garages with heaps of car parts that slope into the river, bleeding paint, metals, and oil into the Mithi, a mere 120 feet wide at this point. On the other side are shanties made of brick, tin, and plastic; metal scrap dealers; and a middle-class housing complex flanked by concrete walls that plunge into the water. Below the bridge, a dark slurry with floating bits of plastic, cloth, and rubber slowly passes downstream, toward the office buildings and construction cranes of MumbaiÃ¢ÂÂs new financial district. Ã¢ÂÂThis is how you kill a river,Ã¢ÂÂ says Daftary, an engineer who works with Jal Biradari, a water conservation group. Along with Vanashakti, a Mumbai-based environmental organization, DaftaryÃ¢ÂÂs NGO prevailed in a case in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Supreme Court last August involving the restoration of the Mithi. The top court reprimanded the local authorities for their neglect and directed independent experts to assess measures taken to date and recommend additional remedies to reverse the degradation of the Mithi. India has seen a string of such judicial rulings involving urban rivers in recent years, as the country comes to grips with the widespread pollution that has fouled waterways and with runaway development that has destroyed or damaged wetlands and floodplains. Across major cities, environmentalists and citizens are engaged in prolonged, seemingly intractable battles to clean up local rivers - mainly through legal petitions intended to force authorities to take action or, in some cases, to stop them taking damaging measures, such as constructing concrete flood walls that hem in the river. Some of these battles have been triggered by recent floods and made more urgent by projections of increased extreme rain events and other climate risks.

The sacred Ganges has been at the center of a legal battle focused on the failure of a government plan to clean up the river.

In the technology hub of Hyderabad, activists went to the National Green Tribunal, a quasi-judicial authority, in 2015 to prevent illegal construction near the cityÃ¢ÂÂs Musi River. In Chennai, in South India, citizens have petitioned the tribunal to stop pollution of the Cooum River, as well as to ensure proper dredging of a large canal to remove silt and improve flow. In New Delhi, activists have been fighting one legal case after another over the years to keep the floodplain and river bed of the Yamuna, a major tributary of the Ganges, free of myriad developments, including a subway depot and road. And the sacred Ganges, which runs through five Indian states, has been at the center of a legal battle by environmentalists and citizens frustrated by the failure of a government plan to clean up the badly contaminated river. Rivers and streams have borne the brunt of the recent urban explosion in India, a nation whose population has nearly doubled in the last 40 years to 1.35 billion. Unplanned growth has led to the use of water bodies as dumping grounds for sewage and industrial effluent. According to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Central Pollution Control Board, 63 percent of the urban sewage flowing into rivers (some 62 billion liters a day) is untreated. In addition, riverbanks, wetlands, and floodplains have been claimed over time by infrastructure, slums, offices, and housing developments - all of which has narrowed natural river channels and distorted flow, greatly reducing the ability of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs rivers to buffer flooding. It also has taken a toll on biodiversity.

The cost of this abuse has mounted over the years. A study last year linked increasing cases of typhoid, hepatitis, and diarrhea in New Delhi to severe pollution in the Yamuna River, which provides much of the cityÃ¢ÂÂs drinking water. Large stretches of the Yamuna, as well as ChennaiÃ¢ÂÂs Cooum and MumbaiÃ¢ÂÂs Mithi and Ulhas rivers, are considered dead zones, with oxygen levels too low to support most fish life.

Environmentalists blame the failure of past cleanup efforts on a host of problems: The political clout of industries, contractor-driven boondoggles, weak enforcement by pollution-control agencies, and clashing government departments. The $3 billion initiative to clean up the Ganges, a flagship project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, must navigate the politics of five states, numerous cities, and multiple central government agencies. Renowned hydrologist Madhav Chitale resigned from the main Ganges cleanup initiative last year partly because, he said, Ã¢ÂÂsome people [in the mission] are focused on religious and cultural issues rather than on the technical remedies.Ã¢ÂÂ He and others point to the Sabarmati River in Gujarat, ModiÃ¢ÂÂs home state, as an example of sound urban river restoration. For decades, the Sabarmati - which runs through the state capital of Ahmedabad - was just another dirty, seasonally dry river. Then architects gave it a makeover, clearing out the slums along its banks and creating a channel of clear water bordered by a long concrete waterfront. The creation of attractive riverfronts is seen by many as key to mobilizing public support for conservation. But some have criticized the Sabarmati project for focusing on beautification rather than ecological restoration. Water was brought from another river to keep the channel full, and pollution has simply been pushed downstream, said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers & People, a conservation group. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt have a success story yet,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The cost of the damage to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs rivers was made painfully clear in December 2015, when Chennai experienced severe rainfall that overwhelmed its river and canal network. The regionÃ¢ÂÂs small rivers had been extensively manipulated over the years and had lost their floodplains to urban development, says Jayshree Vencatesan, managing trustee of Care Earth Trust. Ã¢ÂÂUnless their flow is managed as a grid, they cannot perform their ecosystem services,Ã¢ÂÂ said Vencatesan.

For much of its run, MumbaiÃ¢ÂÂs Mithi River is a glorified sewer serving small workshops, slums, housing developments, and a business center.

The Chennai floods took nearly 300 lives, damaged thousands of homes and businesses, and paralyzed the airport, which is partly built over the Adyar River, all leading to an estimated $3 billion in losses to the cityÃ¢ÂÂs economy. The flood brought attention to the assault on the regionÃ¢ÂÂs natural systems, with marshland shrinking by 45 square miles from 1980 to 2010, according to a study by Care Earth Trust. The disaster provided new impetus to long-pending cleanup plans for the Cooum River, which had languished for decades. Last year the official Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust obtained environmental clearances for a major restoration project.

A similar disaster unfolded in Mumbai on July 26, 2005 when an unprecedented monsoon deluge drowned the financial capital, killing more than 900 people, damaging a quarter-million homes, and causing an estimated $2 billion in economic losses. This inundation made Mumbai residents suddenly aware of the presence of the Mithi River in their midst. A modest channel that begins in suburban hills, the Mithi winds 11 miles down to the Arabian Sea. For much of its run, the river is a glorified sewer serving small workshops, slums, housing, the airport, and a business center. All were inundated on that fateful day when the conjunction of high tide and extreme rain caused the river to overflow its banks and flood the city.

Since then, multiple studies have decried the systematic destruction of the Mithi, pointing to a host of assaults: The airportÃ¢ÂÂs runway had been built over the river, narrowing the channel and forcing it into a 90-degree bend, and a new office district had been built on wetlands. One satellite study found that from 1966 to 2005 the width of the Mithi was reduced by almost 50 percent, while mudflats had shrunk by 70 percent. The experts proposed solutions: close polluting businesses and industries, collect garbage, install sewage plants, restore the banks, dredge the river, create a buffer zone, and nurture the mangroves to absorb future floods. Last August, intense rainfall came perilously close to causing another major flood in Mumbai. That same month, the Indian Supreme Court condemned the lack of progress in restoring the Mithi following the 2005 floods. Despite much expenditure, the river is still filthy and continualy encroached upon, most recently by the dumping of debris from construction of a new subway. Municipal authorities have been slow to set up sewage treatment plants, and the few treatment projects underway donÃ¢ÂÂt hew to expert recommendations. The National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay had called for setting up as many as 37 small sewage plants along the river, rather than a few large ones - a recommendation the city has so far ignored. Ã¢ÂÂThe model from developed countries in which all sewage is taken and treated in one place appears to be impossible here because planning is always far behind population growth,Ã¢ÂÂ said NEERI director Rakesh Kumar. In this context, he said, a decentralized approach might work better. Mumbai has taken some steps in recent years, mainly for flood prevention. Municipal authorities have spent S100 million dredging and widening the river at its narrowest points, and the regional planning agency, which controls the last 3.7 miles of the river, has spent millions more removing silt, demolishing encroaching structures, and resettling hundreds of slum dwellers.

The MithiÃ¢ÂÂs crowded banks point to the social challenges of these cleanup efforts, especially in a city where half the population lives in slums.

But the MithiÃ¢ÂÂs crowded banks point to the social challenges of these cleanup efforts, especially in a city where half the population lives in slums. Relocating slum dwellers and industries takes time - land must be found, consent obtained, people and businesses shifted. Often people are forced out and homes demolished willy-nilly, as has happened on ChennaiÃ¢ÂÂs riverbanks. Rehabilitation sites are usually far away, disrupting community and employment networks. In the neighborhood of Kalina, along the Mithi, residents are furious about having to possibly move to a resettlement complex near polluting oil refineries. Such action seems especially unjust since entities such as the airport and the financial complex have expanded into the riverÃ¢ÂÂs flood plain, and they are not being told to leave. Ã¢ÂÂIf everyone is to blame, why target the slums?Ã¢ÂÂ asked Fayzah Khan, a local resident.",Dying Waters: India Struggles to Clean Up Its Polluted Urban Rivers

In a press release on Saturday, Mr. Madhu pointed out that the scandal would not have happened without the collusion of a few officers in the Revenue Department.
It was the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility to expose the culprits by disclosing the findings of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), he added.
Mr. Madhu said the lands assigned to Scheduled Castes and the poor were occupied in a meticulous manner as the government remained a mute spectator. The government should take punitive action on all those responsible.

131,876,positive,"If it were not for the high-octane, ill-tempered controversy surrounding the killing of a mother tigress, the outpouring of concern from all corners for a tiger would have been an encouraging sign for our times. But the ruthless shooting down of tigress Avni in MaharashtraÃ¢ÂÂs Yavatmal district earlier this month, in what seems to be a botched-up opeÃÂ­ration, gives the whole episode an extremely sordid air. Avni, known as T1 in the foresterÃ¢ÂÂs parlance, was dubbed to be a man-eater and accused of taking 13 human lives. A celebrity hunter was roped in by the state forest department, and his team, after weeks of tracking the tigress, put her down.
Soon, indefatigable conservationists were excoriating the forest department and the hunter Shafath Ali Khan in the strongest of terms. Some argued that there was no conclusive proof that the tigÃÂ­ress had killed 13 humans, let alone of her having eaten the human kills. Maneka Gandhi, Union minister for women and child development and a vociferous animal rights activist, called AvniÃ¢ÂÂs killing by the hunterÃ¢ÂÂs son Ã¢ÂÂpatently illegalÃ¢ÂÂ. The state forest minister and Gandhi exchanged barbs and the hunter threatened to sue the Union minister following her remarks. The autÃÂ­opsy report showed that the bullet entÃÂ­ered the tigressÃ¢ÂÂs torso from one side, thus implying that she wasnÃ¢ÂÂt facing the hunter at the time of shooting, while the hunterÃ¢ÂÂs son had claimed that the tigress had charged at his team. The kind of gun used, claims about the tranquilising effort made, the time of the shootingÃ¢ÂÂall of this have put question marks on the intent and manner of the operation.
Following close on the heels of this killing, a tiger was run over by a tractor in Uttar Pradesh. These cases once again lent relevance to the gravely divisive issue of tiger conservation and man-animal conflict. Experts diagnose a barrage of pathologiesÃ¢ÂÂthe shrinking of forests, indiscriminate development projects, poor capacity-building of forest department staff, fragmentation of forest-to-forest corridors, even the conservation Ã¢ÂÂbusinessÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂall being a fiefdom of the urban elite, who thus sideline the role of the villagers, who are left to face the consequences on ground zero.
P.K. Sen, the former head of Project Tiger, says that the tiger population has grown and the available forest area is proving inadequate for them. Ã¢ÂÂIn addition, the prey base is not enough. The tigerÃ¢ÂÂs yearly meat consumption is in tonnes. If we really want the tigers to remÃÂ­ainÃ¢ÂÂthey are the protectors of our forests, our environment, our river systemÃ¢ÂÂwe must give the tiger space and stop encroaching into their habitat, the forests,Ã¢ÂÂ says Sen, adding that wide roads passing through tiger reserves do great harm to tigers. As if to emphasise SenÃ¢ÂÂs last point, a tiger charged at a tourist vehicle at MaharashtraÃ¢ÂÂs Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve on November 12, leading experts to bemoan yet again the increasing traffic on these roads, and their potential to disturb the natural rhythms of wildlife.
Most persons associated with conservation are livid at the forest departmentÃ¢ÂÂs handling of the Avni case. Ã¢ÂÂBy killing a tiger, an endangered animal alrÃÂ­eady, they are further narrowing down the genetic diversity among the species. And why did it come to an outsider being called to neutralise the tiger? Do none of the forest departments have staff well trained and equipped to tranquilise and capture the animal?Ã¢ÂÂ asks Faiyaz KhuÃÂ­dsar, a wildlife biologist who has the big cat habitat as his area of research. He rues the fact that very little capacity-ÃÂ­building of forest department staff has been done.
The kind of gun used, claims of a tranquilising effort, the time of shootingÃ¢ÂÂ all have cast doubts about the manner of killing tigress Avni.
Furthermore, Khudsar says that tiger conservation in the country has become synonymous with increasing tiger numbers. For tigers to grow sustainably, he says, the whole tiger ecosystem has to grow. Ã¢ÂÂThe Project Tiger also mandated the appointment of a scientist in each tiger reserve, who would help the managers, or the forest officers, in taking infÃÂ­ormed decisions. It hasnÃ¢ÂÂt happened so far,Ã¢ÂÂ he complains, calling the Yavatmal case the Ã¢ÂÂheight of the fightÃ¢ÂÂ and the final call for a lesson that ought to have been learnt long back.
Deforestation seems to be the major cause for the conflict between man and animal, agrees Sarosh Lodhi, the founder member of CLaW (ConseÃÂ­rvation, Lenses and Wildlife). Ã¢ÂÂThe erosion of corridors which connect forests and are crucial for tiger movement, the construction of highways and rail lines through forests, poaching and poor conviction rate in poaching cases, have all contributed to the failure in tiger conservation,Ã¢ÂÂ says Lodhi.
He also contests the idea of tigers becÃÂ­oming man-eaters. Humans do not come in the natural food cycle of the tiger, he says, and the tiger rarely kills a human. Ã¢ÂÂThere have been thousands of incidences where the tiger and the human have been on foot and the tiger has walked away. When there is a chance encounter, the tiger might paw in apprehension. The tiger is so powerful that even the pawing might give the impression that the victim has been mauled by the tiger,Ã¢ÂÂ he adds.
Some others, however, see the issue as a conflict between two classes of peopleÃ¢ÂÂone sitting far away in cities, occasionally visiting forest areas and working to conserve tigers and other wildlife, and the other living close to the tigers and paying for the cost for conservation. Elite conservationists, this line of argument goes, see forests and wildlife as commodities meant to be consumed only by their urban brethren and thus to be made out of bounds for village folk, who are but a negligible factor in the scheme of things. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs one form of use over another. You might think itÃ¢ÂÂs okay for the urban tourist to come and stay in the fancy resorts but not okay for the villagers to collect firewood from the forestÃ¢ÂÂ¦. If somebody is told that the forest and the tiger do not belong to them, why would they worry about their protection?Ã¢ÂÂ asks an indignant Sudha Vasan, an assistant professor of sociology at University of Delhi, who has worked extÃÂ­ensively on society and ecology.
Engagement with villages in the neighbourhood of tiger reserves is essential to the conservation of tigers. Villagers often regard wild animals and the forest department as enemies and a barrier to their rightful use of forest resources. Often, in villages that lie cheek-by-jowl with forest reserves, there seems to lurk a deep hatred for the animals, as villagers feel that itÃ¢ÂÂs because of the animals that their access to forests has been restricted. The ground staff of the forest department, mostly under-equipped, are often caught in a pincer moveÃ¢ÂÂhaving to deal with the perils of the wild as well as to placate hostile villagers.
Tiger conservation seems to be a complex, uphill task, involving a multitude of stakeholders, requiring rigorous engÃÂ­agement and massive consenÃÂ­ÃÂ­sus building. The nationÃ¢ÂÂs oldest and most high-profile conservation effort is still a work-in-progress.",Tigress Avni's Killing: There's A Need To Curate Big Cat Eco-System
132,879,positive,"Bengaluru: As the effects of climate change on livelihoods become more pronounced, especially for people involved in agriculture and fishing in South and South-East Asia, support for rebel groups and the Naxalite movement is likely to shoot up, according to a new report.

There is evidence that climate change will worsen socio-economic and political disparity in the region as those in power will get to decide who gets the limited resources and how much, the report co-authored by researchers Pernilla Nordqvist and Florian Krampe while working for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), has said.

Ã¢ÂÂThe climate-conflict linkage primarily plays out in contexts that are already vulnerable to climate change and violence, and where income is highly dependent on agriculture and fishing,Ã¢ÂÂ Nordqvist told IndiaSpend in an email.

Human activities have already caused warming of 1.0 degree Celsius as compared to pre-industrial times, according to the latest report of the United NationsÃ¢ÂÂ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). By 2030, or latest by mid-century, global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Close to 2.5 billion people live in South and South-East Asia, where poverty rates have been declining substantially, thanks to years of strong economic growth in countries such as India. However, the region is also prone to the fallouts of climate change, with glaciers in the Himalayas melting and several island-countries facing rising sea levels. Floods, cyclones, heat waves and droughts are now a frequent occurrence and are expected to intensify in the coming years.

Ã¢ÂÂThe region is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change and also has a recent history of political violence,Ã¢ÂÂ Krampe told IndiaSpend.

Nordqvist and Krampe examined 2,000 peer-reviewed studies on the relationship between climate change and conflict and narrowed down on 21 of the most authoritative works for their report, which was published in September 2018.

Their findings from India show that rebel groups and government forces both find recruitment easier when drought is around the corner.

The IPCC report also adds that climate-related risks to livelihoods, food security, health, water supply and human security are projected to increase as the planet warms by 1.5 degrees. With a 2-degree rise, the risks will intensify.

In some areas affected by the Naxalite conflict, the worsening of livelihood conditions has been related to the increased intensity of ongoing civil conflicts. During a drought, or a potential drought, there is an increased risk that rebels and government actors recruit or cooperate with civilians in exchange for livelihood and provision of food.

Naxalites could use climate-related events to gain power in an ongoing conflict, and rebel groups more generally could increase their use of violence against civilians to ensure their groupsÃ¢ÂÂ food security, according to the report.

Ã¢ÂÂThey violently remove local farmers from their land to ensure enough cropland and agricultural supplies for their own use. The risk of violence seems especially high in rural areas, where government control is scarce and the local population is dependent on the support or protection of rebels or other armed actors,Ã¢ÂÂ Nordqvist said.

As climate change pushes up migration, it introduces the possibility of riots in urban areas over resources, the report said. Highlighting the case of riots in Tripura in northeastern India, it said the effects will be most felt in areas where there are already low levels of socio-political stability.

Ã¢ÂÂMany of the climate change problems are trans-national. The Brahmaputra, for example, flows through three countries and is seeing frequent flooding. There is no question that countries will need to cooperate and tensions like the ones between countries India and Pakistan will make this difficult,Ã¢ÂÂ Krampe said.

There is some research on the relationship between climate change and conflict in countries such as India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the report said, adding that there is little understanding of how climate change could be driving conflict in places such as Afghanistan and Myanmar.

Elsewhere in South-East Asia, in some coastal areas of Indonesia the reduced income opportunities from fishing have been linked to a rise in piracy-related activities.

But the impact does not end there.

In Pakistan, for instance, the Islamist group Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JUD) was able to increase its stronghold in Sindh province after the group participated in relief activities following extreme floods.

The IPCC report also warns that those living along coasts and populations dependent on agriculture will be the worst hit by climate change, which will push up poverty rates in coastal areas and in developing countries.

However, Ã¢ÂÂNot everyone affected by climate change will join a rebel group but this also relates to the failure of the governments to respond to disasters,Ã¢ÂÂ Krampe said.

At the same time, not all areas will see conflict in the face of climate change. Some might even see a greater cooperation in the aftermath of a natural disaster. These regional dynamics are evolving, however, and their contours will only become clearer with time.

Ã¢ÂÂThere is an urgent need for a climate change risk assessment in South Asia and South-East Asia as right now we simply do not know the risks involved,Ã¢ÂÂ Krampe said.

Naidu visited the Araku Valley on Friday after returning from New York. From Visakhapatnam, Naidu went to Paderu where he reached out to Kidari's family.

Naidu announced Rs 1 crore assistance to the family and government job to KidariÃ¢ÂÂs second son. Ã¢ÂÂWe will politically take care of KidariÃ¢ÂÂs first son. It is a misnomer that the TDP government has encouraged bauxite mining that led to the killings. It was Y S Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR) who opened the Valley for bauxite mining,Ã¢ÂÂ Naidu said.

He said the government is facing cases in international courts for cancelling the leases given during the YSR regime. Ã¢ÂÂDespite that, we have said a big no to mining as it would destroy the livelihood of the tribal community,Ã¢ÂÂ Naidu said.

He condemned the brutal and cold-blooded murder of two tribal leaders. Ã¢ÂÂGenuine leadership in tribal areas is hard to find. After years of toil, only one becomes a leader and what message are the Maoists giving by killing such young leaders?Ã¢ÂÂ Naidu asked.

Mumbai: A misrepresentation of the word ""forest cover"" has led to a flawed government conclusion that IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forests grew by 6,778 square kilometres or one percent Ã¢ÂÂ about the size of Sikkim Ã¢ÂÂ over two years to 2017, various experts told FactChecker.

This increase includes forests converted to commercial plantations, degraded and fragmented forests, and the health of these forests is gauged by satellite imagery of inadequate resolution, they said.

The increase in forests was part of the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs response to a parliament question on 6 April, and was based on IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs state of forest report (ISFR), 2017, which defines Ã¢ÂÂforest coverÃ¢ÂÂ as a 1-hectare (ha) area with a tree canopy of 10 percent or more.

Nearly 708,273 square kilometresÃ¢ÂÂroughly the size of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana combinedÃ¢ÂÂor 21.5 percent of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs geographic area is under forests (including mangroves), according to the forests report.

The term Ã¢ÂÂforest coverÃ¢ÂÂ does not consider the fragmentation of forests and includes plantations, and as studies have shown (here and here), IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forests have been degraded over 100 years.

Ã¢ÂÂFundamentally, the term forest cover, as defined in the ISFR, is misleading,Ã¢ÂÂ said Praveen Bhargav, a former member of the National Board for Wildlife, and trustee, Wildlife First, a conservation advocacy organisation. Ã¢ÂÂForest cover is different from Ã¢ÂÂrecorded forest areaÃ¢ÂÂ which the ISFR defines as legally notified forests.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂWe do not make a distinction between natural forest or forest species in our definition of forest cover in the report,Ã¢ÂÂ Subhash Ashutosh, director general of the Forest Survey of India (FSI), the government organisation that wrote the ISFR report, told FactChecker.

Ã¢ÂÂDespite the fact that other species were included, forest-cover expansion plays a positive environmental and ecological role,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂIt may not be similar to the role of a natural forest, but this is also significant from an environmental point of view.Ã¢ÂÂ

AshutoshÃ¢ÂÂs distinction was contested by various experts.

In 2015, ""forest cover"" nationwide increased by 3,775 square kilometres Ã¢ÂÂ six times the size of MumbaiÃ¢ÂÂ as compared to 2013, according to the State of Forests Report, IndiaSpend reported on 27 July, 2017. This at a time when, globally, forest area (as a percentage of land area) decreased by a percentage point to 30.8 percent over 25 years to 2015, according to World Bank data.

""This ISFR 2017 data flies in the face of several reports of forest degradation in India, particularly because of de-notification, and other forms of development-related clearance,"" said Bharath Sundaram, a forest researcher.

The number of districts sampled in the government survey of 2017 was higher than the number of districts sampled in 2015. The 2015 assessment covered 589 districts while ISFR 2017 covered 633 and this may have pushed up forest estimates, said Sundaram.

There is an ongoing debate on the resolution of satellite imagery the government uses to conduct the forest survey. Experts have sought an improved resolution, Nature, a science journal, reported on 4 September, 2012.

Indian remote-sensing satellites produce images with a resolution of 23.5 metres per pixel, too coarse to unequivocally identify small-scale deforestation based on expert opinion, as per NatureÃ¢ÂÂs report. Instead, it should use imagery with a resolution of 5.8 m per pixel, it was suggested.

A 23.5-m resolution cannot distinguish state-owned forests, private forests, and community-managed forests, a move that is is Ã¢ÂÂobviously politicalÃ¢ÂÂ, Sundaram alleged.

Ashutosh of the FSI acknowledged that current satellite imagery could not record plantations, but he said improving resolution was not immediately possible.

Ã¢ÂÂThe minimum mappable is 1 ha,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ashutosh. Ã¢ÂÂIf it is less than 1 ha, we will not be able to capture in the satellite imagery with the present resolution. It may not detect deforestation of less than 1 ha nor will it capture many plantations. It can go either way.Ã¢ÂÂ

While it was possible to improve the resolution, that process could take between five and eight years, Ashutosh explained. Ã¢ÂÂWe process 323 scenes, with each scene, (spread across) around 19,000 square kilometres,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWith higher resolution, it will increase to 3,000-4,000 scenes, which will need more time to process and analyse.Ã¢ÂÂ

Plantation growth included in forest cover expansion

Plantations grew by around 15,400 square kilometres a year between 1995 and 2005, according to a 2010 Nature report. It further found that native Indian forests declined by 1.5Ã¢ÂÂ2.7 percent over the same period, an average of 2.4 percent a year and a loss of more than 124,000 sq.km over the decade.

Ã¢ÂÂTaking flawed lessons from World Bank-inspired forestry policies, the government, against all advice, pushes for plantation of quick-growing tree species on fragile habitats like river banks, lakes, beaches and even semi-arid, and desert tracts where grasses and their associated species have survived for millennia,Ã¢ÂÂ Bittu Sahgal, editor of Sanctuary Asia, a nature and conservation magazine, told FactChecker.

Why forests are important

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forests are critical for its ecosystem because they absorb 11.25 percent of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs greenhouse gases, according to a ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) report cited in this May 26, 2018, IndiaSpend story. The value of what is technically called an Ã¢ÂÂecosystem serviceÃ¢ÂÂ would amount to Rs 6 lakh crore ($120 billion) or 4.2 percent of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs gross domestic product, according to the August 2009 report.

The increase in forests is important to improving biodiversity and reducing damage caused by natural disasters like floods. States that have reported damage by floods had fewer forests compared to states that had reported less damage, IndiaSpend reported on 22 September, 2017.

At the heart of the forest-cover debate is the definition and density of a forest.

15 states/union territories are 33 percent forestÃ¢ÂÂofficially

Of the 21.5 percent of India categorised as Ã¢ÂÂforest coverÃ¢ÂÂ, 9.3 percent and 9.1 percent is under Ã¢ÂÂmoderately denseÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂopen forestÃ¢ÂÂ, respectively, as per the ISFR report. Only 2.9 percent is Ã¢ÂÂdense forestÃ¢ÂÂ. These categories are based on densities of forest canopies (see definitions below table).

Up to a fifth (21 percent) of the 98,158 square kilometres of Ã¢ÂÂvery denseÃ¢ÂÂ forest is in Arunachal Pradesh, while Chhattisgarh has the highest percentage of Ã¢ÂÂmoderately denseÃ¢ÂÂ forest (10.4 percent), the ISFR report noted.

Categories used in these reportsÃ¢ÂÂvery dense, dense, open, degraded, primary etcÃ¢ÂÂare debatable, noted Sundaram. Ã¢ÂÂGiven the complexity of forest types in India, it makes sense to move to the actual type of forest cover like evergreen, riparian, semi-deciduous, alpine, tropical dry deciduous, and so on,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have mapped forest types in an exercise conducted between 2005-10,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ashutosh of the FSI. Ã¢ÂÂBut this involves mapping, ground truthing, analysis etc, which cannot be done in two years. ItÃ¢ÂÂll require more time.Ã¢ÂÂ

Forests sprawl over more than 33 percent of 15 states and union territories (UTs), of which seven states account for more than 75 percent of forest. Madhya Pradesh (2.3 percent) and Arunachal Pradesh two percent) have the highest proportion of forests as a percentage of national geographic area, while Lakshadweep (90.3 percent) Mizoram (86.3 percent) and Arunachal Pradesh (79.9 percent) have the most land covered by forests.

Loss in forest land and degradation

The data do not take into account forest degradation in India. The Eastern Ghats, stretching from Odisha to Tamil Nadu and covering parts of Karnataka, are important because they support precious biodiversity. These mountains have lost 15.83 percent of their forests over 95 years, noted a February 2018 study by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, University of Hyderabad, and Jawaharlal Nehru University.

Ã¢ÂÂBy not highlighting the challenge posed by continued fragmentation, the ISFR is doing the nation a great disservice,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bhargav of Wildlife First. Ã¢ÂÂSuppressing the negative impact of fragmentation is also resulting in the draft National Forest Policy 2018 ignoring this crucial aspect.Ã¢ÂÂ

The forest loss was 5.8 percent in the three decades ending 2005, highlighting the impact of forest fragmentation on biodiversity, Bhargav said, citing a study by ISRO scientists titled Ã¢ÂÂNational Assessment of Forest Fragmentation in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂ. The study concluded that increased fragmentation in most of the biogeographic zones is due to deforestation.

Decline in forest Ã¢ÂÂgreennessÃ¢ÂÂ

There has also been a decline in the Ã¢ÂÂgreennessÃ¢ÂÂ of Indian forests between 2001 and 2014, as per this study by National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad. Ã¢ÂÂGreennessÃ¢ÂÂ is an index that determines the Ã¢ÂÂvigourÃ¢ÂÂ of a forest and a decline indicates its vulnerability to degradation.

The decline was the highest over tropical moist deciduous forests (20,673.5 square kilometres) in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. About 80 percent of this loss of forest greenness occurred in core, protected areas.

In July 2016, India enacted the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act allocating Rs 41,000 crore ($6.2 billion) for the expansion of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forest cover from 21.34 percent to 33 percent. A large part of compensatory afforestation fund management and planning authority fund must be applied for consolidation of remaining forest blocks and not wasted on raising plantations, noted Bhargav.

Salem: Farmers and land owners in the Salem-Chennai greenfield corridor project area are worried that they might get low value as compensation for their property than the market value.They cited the 33% reduction in guideline value by the state government, which came into effect in June 2017, to drive home their point.The central government has announced a greenfield eight-lane road project between Salem and Chennai via Tiruvannamalai district. The road will be laid for 277km. The central and state government officials proposed to acquire 17,500 acres of agricultural land for the project. They also will acquire 500 acres of forest land, seven river pathways, eight big mountains that are situated in the proposed area between Salem and Chennai.The central government and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) announced that lands will be acquired for the project based on 1956 road map. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswai has announced that compensation will be given to land and house owners based on Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. He said compensation for one hectare will be Rs 8 lakh as per the act.Ã¢ÂÂThe state government had reduced guideline value (GLV) by 33% across the state on June 8, 2017. This will affect our compensation,Ã¢ÂÂ said A Chandramohan, state organizer of the All India Kissan Mahasabha (AIKM).Ã¢ÂÂWe suspect that the state government had reduced the guideline value keeping greenfield project in mind,Ã¢ÂÂ he alleged.The project starts from Ariyanur village in Salem district. The market value for one acre at Ariyanur village is Rs 25 lakh but guideline value is only Rs 4 lakh, he said. Similarly, the market value for one acre of fertile land near Harur in Dharmapuri district is Rs 20 lakh but guideline value is only Rs 3 lakh.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently mooted the idea of launching a new scheme Ã¢ÂÂMarket Assurance SchemeÃ¢ÂÂ and sought the opinion of all states on implementing this from ensuing kharif season.

Under the new scheme, states will be free to procure all crops from farmers for which MSPs are announced, except rice and wheat, which are already being procured by the Centre for PDS.

The Centre will compensate states for any losses capped at 30 per cent of the procurement cost. It will be the statesÃ¢ÂÂ responsibility to dispose of the procured crops.

The TS government feels that it will impose heavy financial burden on state government if only 30 per cent is compensated and convey its opinion urging Centre to review the new scheme. Officials brought this issue to the notice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

At present, the state governments are purchasing crops from farmers directly for MSP based on the approval given by the Centre.

The Centre has been announcing MSP for 23 types of crops. However, the states are purchasing only rice and wheat for MSP directly from the farmers, which are used in PDS.

For other crops, the states are purchasing for MSP based on prevailing market conditions, that too only if the Centre comes forward to sanction funds if prices crash below the MSP.

At present, the Centre has been releasing funds in advance to states to purchase crops for MSPs.

In the new system, the states themselves have to mobilise funds on their own to purchase crops for MSP and dispose the stocks on their own. In case, the price falls below MSP and state government suffers losses, the Centre agreed to compensation up to 30 per cent of losses.

This would mean that the governments had to allocated thousands of crores of rupees in the Budget every year for procurement of crops, which will be a tough task.

Moreover, it would be tough to estimate the price trend of various crops for the entire year and sanction funds accordingly.

Agriculture secretary C.Parthasarathy said, Ã¢ÂÂThough the new scheme is good, there are practical problems involved in this. It would be tough for any state government to sanction huge amount of funds in Budget every year for procurment in the absence of clarity.

The infection has nearly wiped out an entire 26-member pride in just 20 days. (File Photo)
AHMEDABAD: Two more Gir lions died on Monday, taking the death toll in the deadly outbreak of canine distemper virus (CDV) and tick-borne babesiosis in the Dalkhaniya range of Amreli district to 23. The infection has nearly wiped out an entire 26-member pride in just 20 days. The three lions that survive too are battling for life.Ã¢ÂÂTwo more lions of the pride of 26 died on Monday. Of the report of 21 deaths, four lions were confirmed to have died of CDV while 17 succumbed to babesiosis protozoa infection carried by ticks found on most cattle and canines in the wild,Ã¢ÂÂ said Rajiv Gupta, additional chief secretary, forest and environment.Even as the tragedy unfolds, it has come to light that GujaratÃ¢ÂÂs forest department was forewarned twice since 2011 about the presence of CDV in Gir lions. The first warning came in September 2011, when the Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnosis (CADRAD), Bangalore, and Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Uttarakhand, analysed tissues from a 2007 Gir lion carcass and found presence of highly contagious peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). This belongs to the same species of morbillivirus as the CDV.Ã¢ÂÂContinuous serological and clinical surveillance of PPR should be carried out to know its prevalence, impact and possible role of different species in its transmission,Ã¢ÂÂ the researcher had said.Two years later, this very study was quoted by CDV expert Dr Richard Kock of UKÃ¢ÂÂs Royal Veterinary College, who said, Ã¢ÂÂThe lions in India are a small vulnerable population and widespread infection with such a virus can kill at least 40% of Gir lions.Ã¢ÂÂAlarm bells were again sounded when four lions sent to Etawah in UP in 2014 for a lion safari died of CDV by 2016. Former director of Sakkarbaugh zoo in Junagadh and advisor to UP government on lion safari, C N Bhuva said, Ã¢ÂÂIVRI had confirmed that four lions from Gujarat had died in Etawah because of CDV.Ã¢ÂÂ",2 more Gujarat lions dead; toll 23 in 20 days
138,893,positive,"After a villager near Bhopal confessed that he chopped off the paws of a tiger four days back, the poaching of the big cats in Madhya Pradesh has once again become a major concern for wildlife enthusiasts. The toll of tiger deaths in Madhya Pradesh has reached 22 this year as against 26 last year.
Madhya Pradesh used to have the highest number of tigers in India. On Wednesday, an eight-year-old tiger was found dead with severed paws near Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary, 40km from Bhopal. Officials suspected it was a case of poaching for black magic as the tiger's front paws were chopped off and the hair around its tail and eyelashes was missing. Later, a villager named Harchand Singh of Bineka and his four accomplices were arrested.
Ratapani, spread over 890sqkm in the Bhopal-Raisen forest division, is home to 12-15 dominant tigers. Ratapani is likely to be notified as a tiger reserve after getting in-principle approval from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2008.
Once called the tiger state, Madhya Pradesh is home to over 20 per cent of the tiger population in India. It had 308 tigers as per the 2014 wildlife census. Madhya Pradesh also has the highest number of tiger reserves in the country with sixÃ¢ÂÂPanna, Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Satpura, Pench and Sanjay Gandhi National Park.
Madhya Pradesh is also a hub to poachers who regularly exploit the wildlife in the region with a deep entrenched network of smugglers around the protected forest areas. According to a forest department official, primarily nomadic tribes like Pardis, Bhelias and Bawarias are involved in the trade, but with the recent growth in the business of new species, many educated people are also getting involved, said a wildlife officer. The trade is now going online, but the poaching remains with the poor and uneducated people living around the forest areas.
Earlier, in July, forest department sources claimed that going by the preliminary figures of the tiger presence released by the headquarters of Madhya Pradesh wildlife department, the state may soon get back its status of Ã¢ÂÂtiger stateÃ¢ÂÂ. The position had gone to Karnataka in 2014, when the population of tigers dwindled drastically in Madhya Pradesh.
Madhya Pradesh has had a huge population of wild cats in its juggles, which are spread over 30 per cent of its geographical area. Ever since the creation of the first tiger reserve in the 1980s in the state, Madhya Pradesh had been home to the highest number of tigers in the country.
Till 2002, Madhya Pradesh had over 700 tigers. The Panna Tiger Reserve and other habitats of tigers saw several cases of poaching and unnatural deaths of the big cats.
In recently released data of geographical mapping by State Forest Research Institute, the number of places at which tigers had been sighted by state officials was recorded at 1,432 as opposed to 717 such sightings in 2014.
Officials of the forest department point out that this evidence means more animals will be present when the annual tiger count is done by the year-end. As per the 2014 tiger census, Madhya Pradesh had 308 big cats, while Karnataka had 403, the highest in the country.
According to forest officials looking after wildlife protection in the state, the current data suggests that tiger population may reach over 400.","MP: Tiger killed near Bhopal for its paws, 22nd death this year"

143,927,positive,"IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs National Green Tribunal in 2014 banned rat hole mining of coal and its transportation over concerns for the environment and labour conditions in the tribal-majority state of Meghalaya.

Rat hole mining of coal is an unscientific practice to extract coal through narrow tunnels into the ground. It has led to widespread pollution of rivers, deforestation and disruption of traditional values in society.

With extraction of coal tied to rights of indigenous communities over land, the ban was widely resented and challenged.

The road ahead is to restore the environmentally degraded areas and rehabilitate exploited labour force.

The attack on an activist in a coal belt in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs northeast frontier state of Meghalaya has spotlighted the issue of ecological degradation from Ã¢ÂÂrat hole miningÃ¢ÂÂ and the outlawed activities continuing in defiance of a ban on this unscientific sub-surface mining technique in the state.

In November, well-known Meghalaya activist Agnes Kharshiing and her companion were brutally assaulted in MeghalayaÃ¢ÂÂs East Jaintia Hills district when she had reportedly visited the site to document alleged illegal rat hole coal mining despite the interim ban on it.

The hospitalised activist is recovering from her head injuries. This is the second attack on social activists in East Jaintia Hills. In March, a youth leader and RTI activist was murdered.

Condemnation against the attacks by civil society organisations has also brought to the fore the complexities associated with the ban on rat-hole mining.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2014 proscribed rat hole mining of coal and its transportation over concerns for the environment and labour conditions in the tribal-majority state adjacent to the state of Assam and bordering the country of Bangladesh.

The tribunal, however, permitted transportation of already extracted material lying in the open near the sites, subject to certain riders.

The primitive method of rat hole mining (also called box cutting) entails clearing ground vegetation and then digging pits vertically into the ground ranging till one hits the coal seam. Then tunnels are dug in from the sides for extraction of coal, which is brought into a pit by using a conical basket or a wheelbarrow.

The shafts are so small that miners, including women and children, have to squeeze in and crawl on their knees to extract coal using small implements such as pickaxes.

An extremely dangerous method, rat hole mining, is a practice unique to the state because of the thinness of the coal layer, explained environmental studies researcher O.P. Singh of the North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, Meghalaya.

SinghÃ¢ÂÂs findings (with co-author Sumarlin Swer in 2003-2004) went on to form the background for court interventions a decade later.

Ã¢ÂÂRat hole mining is specific to Meghalaya because the coal seam is very thin here so other type of mining will not work because a lot of overburden (waste) will be generated,Ã¢ÂÂ Singh told Mongabay-India.

As large-scale commercialisation of coal mining took-off in the 1980s, mushrooming Ã¢ÂÂrat holesÃ¢ÂÂ triggered alarm over the absence of post-mining treatment and management of the mined areas, labour exploitation and heightened vulnerability of the ecologically fragile areas.

The ban was imposed by the tribunal following a petition filed by the Assam-based All Dimasa StudentsÃ¢ÂÂ Union and the Dima Hasao District Committee. The student body complained that rat hole mining in MeghalayaÃ¢ÂÂs Jaintia hills, had turned the Kopili river that flows from Meghalaya to downstream Assam, acidic.

NGTÃ¢ÂÂs observations were also echoed in the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) report in the same year. The report also singled out damage to the Kopili hydroelectric project due to acidic discharge from the coalmines.

Mining kills caves, rivers and aquatic lifeforms

These coal stockpiles and mining dot the entire state but are primarily concentrated in the Jaintia hills. Meghalaya, the abode of clouds and the lush green landscape of Jaintia hills, is now pockmarked with mining spoils amid swirling black dust and rusty orange rivers.

The rivers and streams of the Jaintia hills are the Ã¢ÂÂgreatest victimsÃ¢ÂÂ of mining, contend Singh and Swer in their reports.

The culprit is the spike in acidity of rivers and streams, when water washes along the sulfur-rich coal (a phenomenon called acid mine drainage or AMD) that degrades water quality and thins biodiversity in the water bodies of the mining area.

Active and abandoned mines, coal storage sites and overburden rocks are sources of this acidic seepage, telltale signs of which can be seen in the reddish orange and brownish hue of of most of the rivers and streams in mining areas in Meghalaya.

Leaching of heavy metals, organic enrichment and silting add on to the burden of water pollution. Most of these rivers and streams flow towards south-east into the flood plains of Bangladesh. However, a few also flow towards northern side into the Brahmaputra valley, SinghÃ¢ÂÂs study notes.

Ã¢ÂÂThe rivers in Jaintia are all dead creating problems for those dependent on them,Ã¢ÂÂ bemoaned Brian D. Kharpran Daly, secretary, Meghalaya AdventurersÃ¢ÂÂ Association, who had filed a petition seeking a ban on mining to save MeghalayaÃ¢ÂÂs intricate network of limestone caves and caverns, some of the largest in the subcontinent. While limestone mining Ã¢ÂÂkillsÃ¢ÂÂ caves, digging deeper for coal also impacts them.

Ã¢ÂÂWhen there is mining, there is deforestation and with the heavy rainfall that we see in Meghalaya, there is heavy erosion. All this eroded soil finds its way into the caves and chokes passages. And this very acidic water that drains off the coal mine, finds its way into the caves which are home to exotic and endemic lifeforms,Ã¢ÂÂ Kharpran said.

Ã¢ÂÂYou have lifeforms which are unique and overnight whatever little population is present is extinguished,Ã¢ÂÂ Kharpran told Mongabay-India.

Smaller streams and rivers either disappear or have become seasonal in nature as surface water trickles into and disappears in the unfilled mine pits and caves, triggering acute shortage of clean drinking and irrigation water in the Jaintia hills, added Singh.

Meghalaya has estimated coal reserves of 559 million tonnes (MT), spread over an area that is slightly larger than the size of the city of Kolkata.

Wildlife and environment protection groups have alleged coal mining goes on under the state governmentÃ¢ÂÂs radar. The NGT coal ban fuelled MeghalayaÃ¢ÂÂs election campaign in early 2018 as parties traded barbs on the inaction to end the ban. Differences in central and state laws have further added to the knotty affair, pointed out Kharpran.

Citing coal mining as a traditional livelihood option, the newly-elected National PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs Party which leads the six-party coalition government Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA), has promised resumption of mining in the state in accordance with IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs environmental norms.

At its helm, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma continues to refute allegations of illegal coal mining in the state.

With the ban inching towards its fifth year, Meghalaya policeÃ¢ÂÂs online records throw up over 700 criminal incidents with the keyword Ã¢ÂÂcoalÃ¢ÂÂ from November 2014 to November 2018.

Mining operations in Jaintia Hills has Ã¢ÂÂundoubtedly brought wealth and employment opportunities in the area, but simultaneously has led to extensive environmental degradation and disruption of traditional values in the society,Ã¢ÂÂ observed Singh in his scientific reports.

Ã¢ÂÂThe situation has not improved since we conducted the tests,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Boon and bane

Adding to the complexity of the issue is the fact that the right to extract coal is connected to the right of tribal communities over their lands.

A 2016 study Ã¢ÂÂTribal communities and coal in Northeast India: The politics of imposing and resisting mining bansÃ¢ÂÂ which discusses the scenario in Meghalaya and Nagaland, two tribal-majority states subject to coal mining bans, notes that bulk of the coal mining activity has been initiated and managed by members of tribal communities rather than profit-driven outsiders.

The study notes that unlike in other parts in India (notably Odisha and Jharkhand) where large state or private enterprises seek to modify the law to enable coal extraction, in Meghalaya it has been communities that resent and challenge laws being applied to their lands.

Under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution the tribal and native communities residing in Meghalaya have exclusive rights over their land, which includes mining operations, explained Kharpran.

The NGT ruling elicited fierce protests by coal mine owners and transport workers and a range of political parties and civil society organisations have also opposed the ban, invoking their belief in the Sixth Schedule. However, Meghalaya comes under the ambit of the central law, the Coal (Mines) Nationalisation Act, 1973.

In parallel at play is the stateÃ¢ÂÂs own mining policy Meghalaya Mines and Mineral Policy (2012) which Ã¢ÂÂdoes not discuss rat hole mining, framed as a Ã¢ÂÂtraditionalÃ¢ÂÂ form of mining that is beyond state intervention, stating in clause 7.6 that Ã¢ÂÂsmall and traditional system of miningÃ¢ÂÂ by local people in their own land shall not be unnecessarily disturbed.Ã¢ÂÂ

This year the state government challenged the NGT ruling in the Supreme Court which has fixed December 4, 2018 as the final hearing date on issues related to coal mining in Meghalaya.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma has also asserted that Coal Mines Nationalisation Act, 1973 has been repealed.

Untangling the curse of the black gold

In August 2018, the National Green Tribunal constituted an independent committee to look into restoration of the environment and related matters.

In the last meeting of the committee in October, MeghalayaÃ¢ÂÂs mining and geology as also forest and environment departments, have suggested use of satellite imageries to survey, map and delineate the coal mines, dumping sites and the areas affected by coal mines. The committee also discussed closing abandoned rat hole mines by controlled blasting.

To counter acidic run-off, the committee batted for the state governmentÃ¢ÂÂs full support to conduct trial treatment of acidic effluents.

Singh, who is assisting the committee as a special invitee, has collaborated with Meghalaya Basin Development Authority to steer a pilot project to neutralise the AMD contaminated acidic water of a stream in East Jaintia Hills District by open limestone channel (OLC).

Ã¢ÂÂThe results were encouraging and the state government is in the process of replicating it in other parts of the district,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

The way forward now is to focus on rehabilitation and restoration of the degraded areas, Singh added.

The government is likely to miss a December deadline to acquire land for a Japan-backed $17 billion bullet train project following protests by fruit growers, officials said, likely delaying one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's most ambitious projects. PM Modi's office is now monitoring the project week-to-week, as officials seek to reassure Tokyo that the hurdles can be overcome through intense negotiations with sapota and mango growers in Maharashtra.Protests, backed by local politicians , have flared up in recent months against attempts to secure sections of a 108-km (67-mile) stretch, which is around one-fifth of the entire bullet train corridor connecting Mumbai with Ahmedabad, the largest commercial city in PM Modi's home state of Gujarat.""I've worked hard for three decades to develop this plantation, and they are asking me to hand over this land,"" sapota farmer Dashrat Purav, 62, said as he showed his orchard in the town of Palghar, a three-hour-drive north of Mumbai.""I haven't worked hard to surrender land for the project. I did that for my children.""Mr Purav said he would sell his land only if at least one of his two unemployed sons was promised a government job.Protests against land acquisitions are common in India, where tens of millions of farmers till small holdings. A planned $44 billion refinery to be run by a consortium including Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, is also struggling to secure land in Maharashtra.""Land acquisition for any project is complex in India,"" said Dhananjay Kumar, spokesman for the National High Speed Rail Corp Ltd (NHSRCL) that is overseeing the project. ""Here also we are facing difficulty because of so much resistance.""Failure to procure the bullet train land by the deadline would delay disbursal of soft-loans by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a government development body, which is reviewing the project next month, said two senior officials with the Indian Railways, declining to be named.A JICA spokeswoman said that the government must create relocation plans for local residents and make them public in order to enter into a loan agreement covering the main part of the bullet train project.""It is possible that it takes time to sign a contract as India takes proper and careful measures in line with JICA's guidelines for environmental and social considerations,"" she said.To assuage Japan's concerns, officials have sought a meeting this month with transport ministry in Tokyo, one of the officials said. The government wants the project's completion target to be advanced by a year to 2022, the 75th year of India's independence.A Japanese transport ministry official who deals with the bullet train project said that Indian officials had told them that ""they can manage"" the land acquisition.""We will continue to work together with the Indian government to bring this project forward with an aim to start operation in 2023,"" the official said.Japan is majority-funding the train project through a 50-year loan. Japanese companies such as Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, JFE Holdings, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi are likely to supply at least 70 percent of the core components of the rail line, sources told Reuters in January.PM Modi has called the project crucial for his pet ""Make in India"" campaign aimed at lifting the share of manufacturing in India's $2 trillion economy. The government also hopes to generate hundreds of jobs through the train project, and hence is pushing hard to finish it on time.To sweeten the terms for people opposed to selling their land, Indian Railways has put its weight behind NHSRCL, pledging funds from its own welfare scheme to build schools and community halls, one of the officials said.Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Indian Railway Board, said the issues with farmers were not insurmountable.The government has offered to buy land at a 25 percent premium to the market value, the two government officials said. Farmers are also being offered resettlement dues of 500,000 rupees ($7,409) or 50 percent of the land value, whichever is higher.However, local political opposition in Palghar, ahead of a general election next year, has fanned the protests. Opponents say the bullet train is wasteful and the money would be better used upgrading the country's rickety rail infrastructure. Farmers have threatened a hunger strike.Last week, farmers and local activists disrupted a public hearing conducted by NHSRCL, its second attempt to hold such an event in less than a month. The first one last month was also cut short by protests. ""In coming weeks we will intensify the protests,"" said Nilam Gorhe, a spokesman for Shiv Sena, the ruling BJP's estranged ally.

145,937,positive,"A transformation in the food system is underway with 100 consumers funding traditional millet farmers

When urban consumers start to think in earnest about their food, from the way it is grown to how they can access nutritious and safe supplies, then it can lead to a transformation in the way the food system operates. No longer able to access nutritious food that is free of pesticides and chemicals, consumers have been casting about them for alternatives. While some have settled for organic food available in supermarkets and niche outlets, a group consisting of 100 consumers from Hyderabad have decided to try a different route.

They believe that the farmer has to be the centerpiece of the new paradigm, and that a direct link with producers alone, will guarantee nutritious supply. After years of debate, the group, which is part of the Hyderabad-based Disha consumer movement that promotes ecological farming, has decided to provide direct monetary support to farmers who have been practising traditional millet-based biodiverse agriculture for decades. In return, consumers will get an agreed quantity of grains after the harvest.

A mini revolution

The beginning of this mini-revolution was initiated in mid-June this year at a hamlet in TelanganaÃ¢ÂÂs Sangareddy district, some 120 kilometres from Hyderabad. A group of enlightened consumers descended on tiny Arjun Nayak Thanda where women farmers dressed in vibrant traditional attire greeted them. It was a meeting of two different worlds that knew little of each other, but were palpably caught in the excitement of a joint enterprise that had brought them together.

The philosophy underpinning this unusual partnership is the belief that Indian agriculture needs to go beyond the organic. Disha convenor D Satya-narayana Raju says that after working for over a decade on the concept of healthy eating, first in Pune and then in Hyderabad, he felt the movement was missing something critical. Ã¢ÂÂWe started with organic and focused on the individual health of consumers. Like so many other organisations we too overlooked something basic: a more sustainable form of agriculture for a better society and came to the conclusion that food had to be viewed in a larger context.Ã¢ÂÂ Disha brings together consumers who want to look at food in a holistic manner starting with sustainable production.

It is a lofty ambition that has made a small beginning in community supported agriculture (CSA) in India. CSA is a concept in which consumers share the responsibilities, risks and rewards of farming. Beginning in the 1970s in Japan and Switzerland, it is now spreading in the US and some European nations. Vegetables and fruits, along with dairy products and meats, are the products most favoured in CSA which is a way of fostering a close bond between farmers and their immediate community. In some cases, consumers offer their labour in exchange for fresh produce.

RajuÃ¢ÂÂs collaboration with the Deccan Development Society (DDS), a non-profit based in Sangareddy, helped sharpen his ideas on the way forward. DDS has been working for over three decades on promoting millet farming that relies on the traditional knowledge of farmers, specially women food producers, to spread the message of food security for cultivators and good health for urban consumers. Together with DDS, Disha named the project Beyond Organic, the ConFarm (consumer-farmer compact). P V Satheesh, DDS director, describes it as Ã¢ÂÂa holistic partnership between ecological food producers and enlightened consumers who are aware of the deep crisis in Indian agricultureÃ¢ÂÂ, and hopes it will change the current dynamics of farm production and the market. DDS works in 55 villages where sanghams (collectives) of women farmers have been set up to strengthen their way of life and farming.

Challenging environment

In all, 83 hectares (ha) have been selected for ConFarm in Arjun Nayak Thanda and five adjoining villages in Sangareddy, and agriculture in these parts present the kind of challenge that urban folk would find daunting. The majority of farmers here are women with plots as small as 0.4 ha. For decades, they have been growing millets such as jowar and bajra to lesser known varieties (barnyard millet), along with dozens of other crops, like lentils and oilseeds.

Bullocks are used for ploughing and there is no mechanisation of any kind. There is no irrigation facility either and the farmer is dependent on the timely arrival of rains. Last year, the harvest was affected by the late rainfall and also by birds feeding on depleted crops.

It was a bad time for farmers. Yet, the consumer-investors of Disha are unfazed by such risks. Ã¢ÂÂWe have been reading so much about the epidemic of suicides by farmers, we felt that something should be done to help them out of a crisis situation,Ã¢ÂÂ says Shrinkla Chandhok, who is part of the Disha consumer movement. Ã¢ÂÂThe real risk is for the farmer and we wonÃ¢ÂÂt be complaining if we donÃ¢ÂÂt get our share of grains.Ã¢ÂÂ

While the 100 consumers have contributed Rs 12,500 to Rs 25,000 each for this season, DDS joint director Jayasri Cherukuri says farmers will get support of Rs 10,000 per 0.4 ha. Grains of equivalent value will be given to the consumers as each crop is harvested.

Needless to say, the farmers are a happy lot. Shakribai, a young woman farmer who heads the DDS sangham in Arjun Nayak Thanda, is delighted that consumers are discovering the food producer and hopes that the Disha movement will spread the message of ecological farming much more widely. Ã¢ÂÂOnce city folk understand the importance of ecological farming and see how healthy we are, they will also begin to eat healthy.Ã¢ÂÂ

GURUGRAM: The sessions court has set aside the civil judgeÃ¢ÂÂs order on the ownership of 464 acres of prime land in GurugramÃ¢ÂÂs Gwalpahari village, saying it belongs to the gram panchayat, and will remain under MCG. In its August 31 order, the court of additional district judge (Gurugram) Jasbir Singh Kundu also said that MCG had to give compensation to the original proprietors (Jumla Mulkaan), mentioned in the revenue records of November 5, 1980 to retain ownership of the land. This ensures compensation for original proprietors and not third parties who purchased the land subsequently and filed civil suits over it.The land, worth Rs 3,000 crore, has been the subject of a tussle between the government and private entities since the mid-1950s when a mutation was carried out, transferring ownership to the gram panchayat. In 2008, when MCG was formed, its municipal limits subsumed Gwalpahari. Earlier, a total of 322 private entities had filed 118 suits, challenging MCGÃ¢ÂÂs claim of ownership over the land. On April 16 this year, the court of civil judge (senior division) Prashant Rana held that the ownership would rest with private owners. MCG had filed an appeal against the order in the session court.Passing its judgment, the session court observed that out of the 118 plaintiffs, seven Ã¢ÂÂ Fateh Singh, Nathey, Atinder, Karam Singh, Raju, Durga and Shyam Lal Ã¢ÂÂ were original proprietors while the remaining 111 were neither Biswedars (proprietors) nor Gair Biswedars (non-proprietor natives) but were claiming a share of the Shamlat Deh (common land) through their civil suits. According to the court, these plantiffs include developers, property dealers or well-to-do persons such as family members of Justice HL Anand (former judge of Delhi High Court), Justice Y K Sabharwal (former Chief Justice of India) and Justice Vijender Jain (former Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court).The court also said since its judgment was subject to appeals before the HC, the parties to the proceedings should maintain status quo in relation to alienation, construction, possession or change of nature of land during the prescribed period for filing an appeal.The court also observed that NC Vashisht, IAS officer and former collector of Gurugram, had admitted appeals by plaintiffs on January 14, 1991, despite a stay order in the matter by the high court on December 12, 1990. It suggested that the chief secretary take departmental action against the official within three months and appraise the court about action taken.The court has also recommended that the collector of Gurugram look into the role of the then gram panchayat for passing a resolution (regarding the sale of land) on May 26, 1993, which, the court observed, could have been passed with ulterior considerations. It also asked the collector to look into the role of government functionaries who did not bring irregularities to the notice of higher authorities concerned. The collector is required to appraise the court of his observations within three months.Further, the court observed that the divisional commissioner, Gurugram, was expected to look into the entire episode and submit a fact-finding report within three months on the role of the local machinery. The official is also supposed to look into other vulnerable pieces of panchayat land/ common land/ gair mumkin land to sensitise the local administration about the same.","Gwalpahari land to remain under MCG, court sets aside earlier order"

He was speaking at Araku and Paderu in the eastern ghats of Visakhapatnam district on Friday after consoling the family members of the two slain TDP leaders. The two were gunned down on Sunday by the Maoists when they were on their way to attend a village meet (Grama darshini) at the Araku Assembly constituency.

Replying to presspersons, he said: ""Where is the question of bauxite mining ? The Telugu Desam Government has repeatedly stated that bauxite mining will not be allowed in the agency area of Visakhapatnam district. In fact, it was the late Rajasekara Reddy, the then Congress Chief Minister, who cleared the bauxite mining proposal. When the TDP came into power, we cancelled all the leases. I myself stated at a public meeting at Paderu that bauxite mining would not be allowed in the agency area and the slain MLA, Sarveswara Rao, was also present in the meeting. It is utter non-sense to suggest that bauxite mining is behind the killings. If anybody is doing it, it is only a pretext or plain mischief.""

He announced that the 2018 has been declared as ZBNF year following the skill development programmes conducted for farmers in 2017 by renowned scientist Subhash Palekar.

He said the State government successfully created awareness among 1.63 lakh farmers in the State on ZBNF. Chandrababu Naidu announced that by the end of this year, at least 5 lakh farmers would learn methods of natural farming. For this, the government prepared detailed plan of action, he informed.

It was aimed to create awareness among 60 lakh farmers by 2024, he added. It is estimated that the government would incur an expenditure of Rs 16,000 crore towards providing training to farmers, seed development and technology support.

Majority of diseases could be avoided by consuming food items cultivated through natural farming, Naidu said. ZBNF protects soil degradation and reduces input cost. Stating that in the future the entire country would go for ZBNF, Chandrababu Naidu said that the AP farmers have to prove that our model would be the best.

He explained that the main goal behind encouraging farmers towards ZBNF was to reduce their input costs and increase the yield per hectare.

New DelhiÃ¢ÂÂ Though on the verge of extinction, pangolins or scaly anteaters Ã¢ÂÂ among the most traded animals in the world that has now found a local market in India Ã¢ÂÂ is yet to catch the attention of the Union government.

With the Environment Ministry keeping its eyes shut to the crisis, saying the animal was Ã¢ÂÂnot yet threatenedÃ¢ÂÂ or calling it a Ã¢ÂÂstate-subjectÃ¢ÂÂ, poaching and trading of Pangolins has grown into an organised wildlife crime, being carried out by the same syndicates that are involved in tiger poaching, according to experts.

Reports show that at least 6,000 pangolins have been slaughtered in India since 2009 for their expensive scales, which are sold for their so-called aphrodisiac properties, though this aspect is yet unproven, scientifically.

In just over a month, till February 11 this year, at least five individual cases of poaching of the Indian pangolin have come to light, with about 13 kg of scales seized, estimated to be harvested by killing 14 to 26 animals.

The Union Environment Ministry, though, still considers it too early to act.

Ã¢ÂÂIt is not something that is going extinct. We (Centre) take up protection of species which are threatened. Pangolin is not threatened yet,Ã¢ÂÂ Director General of Forests in the Environment Ministry, Siddhant Das, told IANS, adding, Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a state subject.Ã¢ÂÂ

He also said that so far the Centre has no plans for its conservation.

However, experts and records disagree. India is home to two of the eight pangolin species found across Asia and Africa Ã¢ÂÂ the Indian pangolin and Chinese pangolin.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Pangolin is enlisted in Ã¢ÂÂred-listÃ¢ÂÂ, with the Indian pangolin listed as Ã¢ÂÂendangeredÃ¢ÂÂ and the Chinese pangolin listed Ã¢ÂÂcritically endangeredÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a step behind Ã¢ÂÂextinctionÃ¢ÂÂ.

Pangolin is a mammal with ants as its primary prey. Its tongue is longer than its body to help it catch as many as 20,000 ants per day. The species is threatened due to its scale, made of keratin Ã¢ÂÂ like human nails.

According to a senior ministry official, demand for pangolin scales are largely in south Asian countries. However, recent investigations have shown that India is emerging as a new market.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have got indications that they are also being consumed locally in India Ã¢ÂÂ partly for medicinal purposes and partly for superstition,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr Saket Badola, Head of Traffic-India, a wildlife trade monitoring network and part of WWF, told IANS.

In some parts of country, pangolin meat is also consumed as a delicacy, he added. Among the parts of the animal which have been seized recently, most has been meat. Ã¢ÂÂCountries which have taken up studies show that their population is dropping, mostly due to poaching,Ã¢ÂÂ Badola said.

Ã¢ÂÂThere is a huge network working Ã¢ÂÂ maximum seizures were from border area of Manipur and ports of Tamil Nadu,Ã¢ÂÂ Badola said.

Realising the threat, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an international agreement between governments, listed pangolin under Appendix-I in October 2016, barring its trade across the globe. In India too, the species is listed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972.

In India, it is currently the most poached animal, with central India Ã¢ÂÂ Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra Ã¢ÂÂ emerging as the the most preferred poaching grounds.

According to Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), out of five poaching cases in 2018, two were from Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh, of about 7 kg of scales. Among these cases was one where local smugglers Ã¢ÂÂ including a government official Ã¢ÂÂ offered to sell 12 kg of scales for Rs 50,000 a kg. Only 5 kg of the scales could be seized by authorities, though.

Ã¢ÂÂIts now an organised wildlife crime and itÃ¢ÂÂs time to get serious,Ã¢ÂÂ Tito Joseph from WPSI told IANS.

In 2016, there were a total 22 cases of seizures, included the three biggest ones so far Ã¢ÂÂ 123 kg of scales in May, 93 kg in June from Mizoram and 86 kg at New Delhi Railway station, seized by a CBI team. Four people were arrested in Delhi, all of whom are out on bail now.

According to eminent scientist Dr Y.V. Jhala from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), there is Ã¢ÂÂnot a single studyÃ¢ÂÂ on the habitat, behaviour or population estimate of the pangolin.

Officials tracking pangolin poaching say they lack resources to tackle the problem. Ã¢ÂÂWe had to refer the recent case (of poaching) to the Special Task Force since we have very limited resources to tackle the syndicate involved locally,Ã¢ÂÂ a Madhya Pradesh forest official told IANS on condition of anonymity.

And certainly not to sell his land.Singh is headman of Rohi, the village that virtually holds the veto on land acquisition for the UP governmentÃ¢ÂÂs prestige project Ã¢ÂÂ Jewar international airport. More than a third (481hectares) of the 1,263 hectares the UP government has to immediately acquire in the first phase is in Rohi.Earlier this week, during negotiations with the government, residents of Rohi refused to accept the rate being offered for their land Ã¢ÂÂ up to Rs 2,500 per square metre. They stuck to their demand of four times the circle rate, which is Rs 3,600 per sqm (1hectare is 10,000 sqm).Frustrated government negotiators have since gone public with their views that the airport project may have to be moved elsewhere if the farmers do not scale down their demand. Even chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked them not to be too rigid on prices. But farmers say all they want is to secure their future, and need the money they receive to settle elsewhere, buy land and fund their childrenÃ¢ÂÂs education.In all the six villages notified for acquisition Ã¢ÂÂ Dayanatpur, Kishorpur, Banwariwas, Parohi, Ranehra and Rohi, all just off the Yamuna Expressway around 60km from Noida Ã¢ÂÂ most residents are willing to sell their land and houses, say villagers. But anxiety about the price is stopping them from making a commitment. A social impact assessment report, submitted in June, had cited the same concern about land acquisition.Around 87% of the 1,263 hectares to be acquired is under cultivation, another reason why villagers insist the price must be Ã¢ÂÂfairÃ¢ÂÂ. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a loss of livelihood, homes and land,Ã¢ÂÂ says a farmer.Ã¢ÂÂWe will be displaced from our ancestral homes and land. We will have only the compensation amount to rebuild our homes and lives afresh, at some new place. DonÃ¢ÂÂt we deserve to be suitably compensated?Ã¢ÂÂ asks Vijay Pal, a resident of Kishorpur.The social impact assessment report submitted in June 2018 states farmers in Jewar are mainly involved in cultivation of wheat (54.4%), paddy(12.2%), bajra and jowar (14.7%) and maize (9.4%). Around 34% farmers own less than 2.5 hectares. Around 5% of those being asked to sell their plots are large landowners.The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has placed large hoardings in these villages informing the area has been notified for the airport and any construction is prohibited. District magistrate B N Sigh says the talks are in progress to get farmersÃ¢ÂÂ consent: Ã¢ÂÂThey are responding positively. We will hold further meetings with them.Ã¢ÂÂ",We expect a Ã¢ÂÂfair priceÃ¢ÂÂ from govt: Jewar farmers
155,1026,positive,"Several thousand farmers from different parts of North India who are associated with Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) gathered at Baba Tikait Ghat in Haridwar on September 23 to start the Ã¢ÂÂKisan Kranti YatraÃ¢ÂÂ. Yesterday, on October 2, these farmers flocked to the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, where they were met with violence.
On the International Day of Non-violence and on the birthday of Lal Bahadur Shashtri, who said Ã¢ÂÂJai Jawan, Jai Kisan,Ã¢ÂÂ the farmers were lathi-charged and tear gas shells were fired on them leading to many of them getting injured.
BKU was established by Mahendra Singh Tikait, who led the farmers 30 years ago and all of Delhi came to a halt until the demands of the farmers were met by the government. A similar attempt is now being made by Naresh Tikait who became president of the BKU after the death of his father Mahendra Tikait in 2011. The horde of farmers began the protest from Haridwar and proceeded via Muzaffarnagar and Meerut.
Violence at UP-Delhi Border
The convoy reached Ghaziabad on October 1, where Section 144 was in effect and gathering of five or more than five people was not allowed, reported The Indian Express. The police used tear gas and water cannons to control the violent crowd at UP-Delhi border and Rapid Action Force was called to stop the farmers.
The farmers, who also engaged in sloganeering, broke the barricades set up by UP police with their tractors and proceeded towards the barricades set up by Delhi police. The police launched water cannon to disperse the protestors. They also lathi-charged the farmers.

What are the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ demands?
The reasons for this protest are many, the most significant one being the implementation of the Swaminathan CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations. According to media reports, five reports were submitted by the commission between 2004 and 2006 aimed at Ã¢ÂÂfaster and more inclusive growthÃ¢ÂÂ for farmers.
Upon implementation, it would lead to a more reasonable MSP for farmers. Other demands include reducing the cost of diesel and electricity and continuous supply of electricity during noon when the workload is maximum. Removing the NGT ban on ten-year-old diesel vehicles, paying off the pending dues for sugarcane and complete waiver of loans are among the other demands put up.
Allowed to enter Delhi after midnight
The assurances given by the government were not accepted by BKU and the protest continued even after Home Minister Rajnath Singh was ready to meet most of the demands. The protest was called off once the farmers reached Kisan Ghat, the memorial of Chaudhary Charan Singh after midnight.
As reported by The Quint, Ã¢ÂÂThe farmers remained unfazed despite all the hardships. We have been marching for 12 days now, farmers are tired as well. We will continue to demand our rights to the government but for now we are ending the march,Ã¢ÂÂ Tikait told IANS at Kisan Ghat.
All the farmers started going back on Wednesday after the victory over the government. However, out of the nine demands, the two most important demands were still not accepted which were loan waivers and implementation of the Swaminathan report.
Everyone condemned violence against farmers
Speaking up against the Ã¢ÂÂinhumanÃ¢ÂÂ treatment met out to the farmers, Congress spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala said, Ã¢ÂÂWhat is the Modi government doing on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi? What is the govt doing on the birth anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri who said Ã¢ÂÂJai Jawan Jai KisanÃ¢ÂÂ? The govt is brutally beating up IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs farmers. It has launched a police raj and unprecedented atrocities on the farmers of the country. Can IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs farmers not come and tell their own government that they are in deep pain and suffering from deep rural indebtedness?Ã¢ÂÂ

158,1066,positive,"When Shalini Sahni moved back to India after eight years in the U.S., she craved a waterside home like the one she had in Austin, Texas. This was not an easy thing in Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru), a landlocked, densely populated city in the middle of South India. But the electronics engineer found something similar in an apartment complex fringing Bellandur Lake, the cityÃ¢ÂÂs largest. Less than a year after moving in, her beautiful view of the lake was one of flames on the water.

The January 19 blaze burned for more than 30 hours and rained down ash on balconies and cars more than six miles away. Less than two weeks later, the lake caught fire again. Bellandur Lake made international headlines last February when videos of a fire went viral. But there have been major fires going back to 2015.

Another searing image of the 900-acre lake is a snow-white foam that often covers its canals. It has even bubbled up to a height of several stories and toppled onto roads and buildings nearby.

Ã¢ÂÂWhy in the world would a lake catch fire?Ã¢ÂÂ Sahni asked. Ã¢ÂÂWater should be used to extinguish, not be fuel for a fire.Ã¢ÂÂ

But whatÃ¢ÂÂs in the water is the same thing fueling the fires and the froth. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a potent mix of domestic and industrial waste.

Boomtown Blues

Unchecked development propelled Bangalore, once a sleepy Ã¢ÂÂpensionerÃ¢ÂÂs paradise,Ã¢ÂÂ to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs outsourcing and IT hub of 10 million people. About 40 percent of the cityÃ¢ÂÂs untreated sewage flows into Bellandur Lake every day. Industries discharge effluents directly into the water. City residents find the banks of the lake an easy place to throw their garbage, as do trucks, which regularly dump construction debris. What results is a lake that can catch fire, whether through solid or liquid waste floating on its surface, or flammable methane generated from its oxygen-starved waters.

Seen in a larger context, the toxic waters of Bellandur Lake are just one example of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs struggles to protect its environment. The country slipped to the bottom five worldwide on the recently released Environmental Performance Index, a program by Yale and Columbia Universities and the World Economic Forum that measures environmental health.

Ã¢ÂÂThe fire in the lake was a first-of-its-kind event in India. But this is a warning for every other city in the world which is developing,Ã¢ÂÂ said Priyanka Jamwal, an environmental scientist.

Jamwal studies the water quality of BangaloreÃ¢ÂÂs lakes at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment. By coincidence, she tested Bellandur Lake just a day before the first fire of this year. She found that 70 million gallons of sewage enter the lake every day. Jamwal said the solution is sewage treatment and regular monitoring of streams feeding the lake.

But the government is struggling to keep up with BangaloreÃ¢ÂÂs rapid urbanization. Large-scale sewage treatment plants wonÃ¢ÂÂt be in place until 2020. Bellandur and other lakes in the cityÃ¢ÂÂmanmade and constructed for irrigation in the 16th centuryÃ¢ÂÂare nearly all polluted. But managing waterbodies is complicated by a tangle of oversight among five state and local agencies. (Learn how India planted 50 million trees in one day.)

Complex Oversight

One of those overseeing agencies, the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority, was created in 2015 to monitor illegal activities, including by other government bodies. But Seema Garg, its chief executive officer, said her agency is understaffed and she has no police personnel to round up lawbreakers.

Garg said the lake authority is overseeing the creation of 150 acres of wetlands near BellandurÃ¢ÂÂs inlets before the summer monsoon as a stop-gap measure before sewage treatment plants are built in two years. Even IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs federal environmental body is now involved, demanding answers from local government on the slow pace of clean-up after last FebruaryÃ¢ÂÂs fire.

Sharachchandra Lele studies the governance of BangaloreÃ¢ÂÂs lakes, also for the Ashoka Trust. He is a member of an executive committee comprising scientists, government officials, and residents that oversees Bellandur Lake. That group has documented the presence of heavy metals and a decline in native fish species. The committeeÃ¢ÂÂs last report recommended a list of short-term and long-term goals to improve the lakeÃ¢ÂÂs water quality. Since it was published in November 2016, Lele said the government has met only one short-term goalÃ¢ÂÂreducing invasive water hyacinth plants.

Lele also advises some perspective on Bellandur Lake and its very visible fires and foaming.

Ã¢ÂÂIf you look at it from the consequences of public health, the lake is not that crazy,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not like lead in the pipelines of Flint, Michigan. We donÃ¢ÂÂt use any lake water for drinking. So it becomes a public image issue.Ã¢ÂÂ

But thatÃ¢ÂÂs a tough sell to many residents living near the lake. (See how an India man saved his island.)

Hope for the Future

Ã¢ÂÂThe burning of the lake is a sum of apathy and politics,Ã¢ÂÂ said Seema Sharma.

From her floor-to-ceiling windows in a spacious apartment overlooking the lake, isolated pockets of white smoke indicated small fires in progress. Sharma, a manager at an analytics company, said she saw all three of the very large fires on the lake. But there are small ones along the lake banks every day, she added, along with a steady parade of trucks dumping garbage and debris. She said the sight is so depressing that she often keeps the curtains closed.

The view is not the only problem. A frequent stench floats up from the lake, once getting so bad that her husband initially thought someone in the family had not flushed the toilet. The smell lasted on-and-off for three weeks.

Sharma is also a member of the Bellandur Lake Citizen Group and said sheÃ¢ÂÂd like to see more lake oversight handed to private citizens. Bolstered with funds from nearby IT companies, she believes citizen groups could be more effective in cleaning and managing the lake.

Last August, she helped organize a lake festival, a chance for government officials and residents to connect with each other and learn more about Bellandur Lake. It was held about a half-mile from the shore. For those few hours looking at its waters, a safe distance from its smell and garbage, Sharma said she could see what the lake could be.",Why This Lake Keeps Catching on Fire

There is silence in most parts of the Ramanagara silk cocoon market, about 60 kilometers from Bengaluru. The e-auctioning of cocoons is underway in AsiaÃ¢ÂÂs largest silk cocoons market. Hundreds of farmers from across Karnataka and the rest of India have brought their produce to be sold through bidding. Having emptied their cocoons onto the marketÃ¢ÂÂs tables, they stand next to their produce. Dozens of reelers Ã¢ÂÂ those who reel the cocoons together to produce silk threads Ã¢ÂÂ have come to the market to buy cocoons. The four warehouses in the market are choc-a-bloc with loads of silk cocoons of various grades and qualities.
Reelers make their way around the market, observing the quality of cocoons and silently making their bids over a mobile phone app. Most of the farmers look forlorn. The reelers donÃ¢ÂÂt seem too happy either. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre not even making the costs of production nowadays, how can we be happy,Ã¢ÂÂ says Ashok Hanabaretti, a farmer who has come from Belgaum, 530 kilometers from Ramanagara.
Severe price drop
Ã¢ÂÂIn the last few months, the price for cocoons has gone as low as it was in 2015 when ten farmers committed suicide because they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt repay their debts,Ã¢ÂÂ says Gautam Gowda, silk farmer and president of the Ramanagara District Sericulture FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Welfare Association. Gowda, like countless others, comes to the Ramanagara silk market every month to sell his produce. The average price of the two most sold silk cocoon types, Bivoltine silk and Cross Breed silk, were Rs 360 and Rs 290 respectively at the end of September as compared to Rs 491 and Rs 395 last year, as per KarnatakaÃ¢ÂÂs Department of Sericulture. Ã¢ÂÂThe government needs to intervene and assist us, otherwise we will fall into debt,Ã¢ÂÂ says Gowda.
In July, silk farmers marched to Freedom Park, Bengaluru, to protest the fall in prices. They were hoping that the state legislative assembly elections in May would bring about proactive changes in sericulture but to no avail. In fact, upon coming to power, SR Mahesh, the incumbent minister for sericulture, announced that Mysuru silk saris would be sold at half the price by the Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation (KSIC). His Ã¢ÂÂhalf-priceÃ¢ÂÂ offer was withdrawn a month later after multiple disturbances outside silk stores across the state.
The ministerÃ¢ÂÂs announcement turned out to be premature as the state lacked the capacity to back his promise. Ã¢ÂÂThe state seems to be doing only foolish things and the centre is supporting only weavers and traders, most of who are in the north, in places like Varanasi. Who do we go to with our issues?Ã¢ÂÂ asks Shanta Kumar, a silk farmer from KarnatakaÃ¢ÂÂs Davanagere district.
India is the second largest producer of silk in the world. Half of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs silk is produced in Karnataka.
Heavy rain in silk producing districts of Ramanagara, Mysuru, Chikballapur and Kolar have filled the silk cocoons filled with moisture. Ã¢ÂÂThe cocoon needs to be dry and soft and not hard like this,Ã¢ÂÂ KM Jaffar, a reeler, tells us, pressing a cocoon from a farmerÃ¢ÂÂs produce. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂll need up to 10 kilograms of such substandard cocoons to produce one kilo of pure silk. This is leaving us with no profit,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.
Another reason attributed to the low prices is the five per cent GST on silk yarn and fabric. Farmers and reelers say this is passed down the supply chain, because of which they have to bear extra burden.
Farmers also say that silk yarn imported from China is preferred by weavers for its low price and this has put the domestic market in further peril.
A temporary setback
The State Department of Sericulture and the Central Silk Board (CSB), a statutory body under the Union Ministry of Textiles, say this is only a temporary setback. The CSB is a research and development organisation whose mandate is to provide technical and technological support to the silk industry. Ã¢ÂÂWe are constantly working to improve productivity and reduce risk factors and believe the rates should improve again soon,Ã¢ÂÂ adds the official.
KS Manjunath, commissioner for sericulture development, Karnataka, says that the decline in prices is the result of surplus in supply as well as the excessive rains. Ã¢ÂÂAs more and more farmers are getting into sericulture there is a lot of supply of silk cocoons. Silk farmers are getting eight to ten crops in a year now. WeÃ¢ÂÂre providing subsidies to farmers for setting up rearing houses, medicines for plants and other equipment and are ready to help them in any other way we can,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.
Heavy rain and increasing competition from Chinese silk have drastically affected the prices of cocoons this year. ( Arijit Sen/HT Photo )
Munshi Basaiah, deputy director of sericulture in Ramanagara, concedes that low rates have led to low profit margins for the farmers. Ã¢ÂÂThis is where farmers from all over the country get the best prices for their cocoons between February and May, and then August through October. We have sanctioned 52 automatic silk reeling machines which produce world-class silk. Once these machines are up and running, the quality of the silk thread will also improve and both reelers and farmers should get better profits,Ã¢ÂÂ he says.
Meanwhile, inside the Ramanagara market, the bidding had come to a close. M Manu, a farmer from Maddur, has sold Bivoltine silk, which usually fetches at least Rs 400 per kilo, for only Rs 250 per kilo. He says, Ã¢ÂÂWe had no choice but to sell it for such a low price as there were no better offers. My family and I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what to do if this situation continues.Ã¢ÂÂ

160,1080,positive,"The seven assassination convicts of Rajiv Gandhi, who are jailed in Tamil Nadu cannot be released, the Indian government told the Supreme Court on Friday asserting that the case involves the assassination of a former Prime Minister, the NDTV said today.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of India, which investigated the case, has opposed the release of the seven convicts, the court was told.
Tamil Nadu had been informed of the decision on April 18, the centre told the court. The seven convicts had been in jail for 27 years.
The court had asked the centre to decide and respond to Tamil Nadu's request to release them. A constitution bench of top Supreme Court judges had said in 2015 that the convicts cannot be released without the central government's consent.
The convicts, Perarivalan, Murugan, Santhan, Nalini Sriharan, Robert Pious, Jayakumar and Ravichandran, are serving life terms. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 by a woman operative of the LTTE, who greeted him at a rally in Sriperumbudur town with a bomb strapped to her chest.
In April, the Madras High Court rejected Nalini Sriharan's request for early release. Her death sentence had been commuted on the request of Congress leader Sonia, the wife of Rajiv Gandhi.
Another convict, Perarivalan, had requested that the case be reopened and his conviction be cancelled. The Supreme Court rejected it in March.
Perarivalan was convicted for supplying two nine-volt batteries for the belt-bomb. He was 19 when he was arrested weeks after the assassination. He told a court that he had no idea what the batteries were for.
Perarivalan spent 14 years in solitary confinement after being sentenced to hang. His death sentence was changed to life term by the Supreme Court in 2014.
Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the son of Rajiv Gandhi, had said he had no objection to Perarivalan's release, a Tamil film director, PA Ranjith, was quoted as saying recently.
In 2014, then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa decided to release the convicts but the centre - the Congress-led government was in power - challenged her decision. The Supreme Court then said the state could not take such a decision without the centre's sanction, as the case was investigated by the CBI.",Can't free Rajiv Gandhi's killers: Indian Govt. tells SC

Thousands of farmers and labourers from across the country held a massive protest in the national capital on Wednesday against what they called 'anti-people' policies of the Modi government, and demanded higher prices for farm produce, waiver of loans and better wages.

The protesters, holding placards and shouting anti-government slogans, marched from Ramlila Maidan to Parliament in Central Delhi, and warned the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party that it will have to pay a 'heavy price' in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls for 'ignoring' the demands of the disadvantaged people.
The 'Mazdoor Kishan Sangharsh Rally', organised by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) and All-India Agricultural Workers' Union (AIAWU), also demanded concrete measures to generate jobs, minimum monthly wage of Rs 18,000 for workers, halting 'forcible' land acquisition and stopping changes in labour laws.
The organisers claimed nearly 1.5 lakh farmers and labourers from at least 23 states have participated in the protests, preparation for which had started several months back. The protest has thrown the traffic out of gear in several parts of Delhi.
""The massive protest is a warning to the BJP government ahead of the Lok Sabha elections as for the last four years it has ignored the demands of the farmers and the workers. The BJP will have to pay a heavy price for it,"" said Tapan Sen, general secretary of CITU, a leading trade union.

Carrying red flags and wearing red caps, the marchers raised slogans against the policies of the BJP government and assailed the ruling party's 'communal and divisive' agenda.
The organisers said this was the first time after Independence that farmers and workers jointly participated in a rally against the government.
The farmers in various parts of the country have been holding protests demanding loan waiver and better prices for farm produce.
Addressing the rally, AIKS leader Vijoo Krishnan claimed 36,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last few years and said the BJP government is piling up miseries on the marginalised section.

Ã¢ÂÂHowever, more intelligence-led enforcement is needed to proactively stop poachers from carrying out these activities. The rise in cases is also indicative of more demand from the international illegal trade market,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

Leopards are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), under the environment ministry, said there was need for better intelligence in tracking poaching.

Ã¢ÂÂMore awareness is needed within reserved forest areas, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and their peripheral areas. India has reduced the number of tiger poaching cases significantly through the use of technology by developing mobile applications. A similar focus needs to be shifted to leopards now,Ã¢ÂÂ said M Maranko, additional director, WCCB.

Ã¢ÂÂA lot of this poaching is related to man-animal conflict,Ã¢ÂÂ said Vidya Athreya, wildlife biologist. Ã¢ÂÂPeople are attacking, poisoning or killing leopards due to loss of livestock. In Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, people are going inside the forests to shoot animals for sport. As a result, these animals turn aggressive towards humans and are then termed Ã¢ÂÂproblem animalsÃ¢ÂÂ.Ã¢ÂÂ

Anish Andheria, president, wildlife conservation trust and member of Maharashtra state wildlife board, said, Ã¢ÂÂThe figure of 90 confirmed leopard poaching cases is probably a gross underestimate. Electrocution and poisoning are quiet killers. These deaths generally remain undetected.Ã¢ÂÂ

Friday's demonstration was the latest of several such protests this year.
On Wednesday, some 50,000 people marched in the eastern city of Kolkata in solidarity with farmers.
In March, thousands of women farmers marched into Mumbai alongside their male peers in March, demanding recognition of their rights over forest and farmland.
Campaigners said implementation of the landmark 2006 Forest Rights Act (FRA), which was meant to benefit a fifth of India's population, has been hobbled by conflicting legislation and a lack of political will.
At the same time, states have diluted several protective clauses of the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 to speed up purchases for industry and infrastructure.

An elephant that was part of a group hunting a man-eating tigress in western India ran astray overnight and trampled a woman to death, an official said Thursday.
The pachyderm was one of five elephants engaged in a search operation for a tigress that is suspected to have killed up to 13 people in Maharashtra state.
""The elephant left the base camp and travelled a distance of 20 kilometres in the night and killed a woman,"" forestry official A.K Mishra told AFP.
The elephant was later captured and all five animals were relieved of their duties, Mishra added.
The Indian Express newspaper said the victim was 35 years old.
The hunt for the tigress, who is being called Avni, which means earth in the local language, began after she was reported to have killed five villagers in the past year, Mishra said.
Officials suspect she may also have been responsible for another eight deaths stretching back to 2016, he added.
""Operations to hunt down the tiger and capture her cubs are on as per the Supreme Court directives,"" Mishra said.
The elephants were originally used by armed forest rangers who sat atop the animals as they entered thick forests inaccessible by vehicles.
Last month India's highest court dismissed appeals by activists that it intervene to stop the rangers from shooting dead Avni.
More than 9,000 people have signed a petition on Change.org calling for the tigress to be captured alive rather than killed.
Tigers do not generally attack humans, but some experts believe they can get a taste for human flesh once they have attacked once.
India is home to more than half of the world's tiger population with some 2,226 of the animals roaming its reserves, according to the last count in 2014.
Dozens die every year, sometimes at the hands of poachers, while reports of man-animal conflict are not uncommon. Wildlife activists say they occur when humans encroach into tiger corridors.
In October 2016 armed forest guards shot dead a man-eating tiger in northern India.
It was blamed for killing three villagers, including a woman outside Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand state.

Narendra Modi had promised to double farm incomes in five years during 2014 election campaign. Instead, they have actually declined on average in real terms, and in any case, become even more volatile. Now the goalpost for doubling farmers' incomes has been officially shifted to 2022, but few are buying that promise any more. The real problem is not about policies but lack of insight and government is acting like a shoemaker who blames the feet when the shoes donÃ¢ÂÂt fit.
The fact is rural India, which politicians fondly remember as Ã¢ÂÂBharatÃ¢ÂÂ to harvest electoral dividends, has an estimated 90.2 million agricultural households dependent mainly on cultivation. Bureaucrats lack inputs from the ground zero while drafting the solutions for cultivations of ideas in Lytyens Delhi.
Hence, they have failed to answer a simple question Ã¢ÂÂ why a farmer in rural Maharashtra is paid just Rs 2 for one kilogramme of tomato that is sold for Rs 50 per kilogramme in the big cities?
The ill-conceived effort to resolve woes of farmers, who are harvesting debt every month, through official presentations is nothing more than a repetitive process irrespective of the shades of power in the Centre since independence. It is a cruel and well-known fact that half of the IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs agricultural household is overburdened with debt besides facing various issues of unviable and unsustainable farming.
To mitigate the chronic farmer distress needs a much more holistic and comprehensive policy response. It requires: more attention to irrigation (both surface and groundwater), more funding of agricultural research oriented to current concerns, better and more comprehensive extension services to enable all farmers to make use of available technologies properly, improved access to reasonably priced inputs without being misled by input dealers with conflicts of interest, proper public procurement across different crops that ensures that the declared minimum support price does become the market floor price, improved management of post-harvest produce including by providing cold storage facilities everywhere, better regulation of market yards so that farmers are not duped or exploited, ensuring affordable access to credit for all farmers and not allowing accumulated interest to exceed the original principal amount of the loan, better conditions for crop insurance which is currently so restrictive as to provide little benefit, more systematic policies for livestock management Ã¢ÂÂ and of course, expanding possibilities for non-agricultural activity in rural areas.

The farmers, in groups representing different organisations, started walking from five different locations entering the National Capital to be part of the march to press for their demands. Enroute, the marching farmers were provided with food and water by volunteers of different farmer organisations.
Ramabai, 45, who left home in Kolhapur, Maharashtra on Monday, reached Delhi on Thursday morning. She donned a red T-shirt of All India Kisan Sabha before joining the march at Shri Bala Sahib Gurudwara.
Ã¢ÂÂThere are 10 people in my house and the prices of rice, wheat and dal have shot up. ItÃ¢ÂÂs difficult to sustain the household,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ramabai, who works in the field of her landowner.
Organised under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella body of about 200 farmer organisations from across the country, the march moved towards Parliament for a rally on Friday morning after halting for the night at Ramlila Ground.
Among the groups, a farmersÃ¢ÂÂ delegation from southwest DelhiÃ¢ÂÂs Bijwasan on Thursday was led by Yogendra Yadav, the president of Swaraj India and one of the working group members of AIKSCC. Yadav termed the protest as Ã¢ÂÂone of the biggest marchesÃ¢ÂÂ of farmers in recent times. The biggest congregation, however, was of over a thousand farmers who walked from Sarai Kale Khan under AIKSCCÃ¢ÂÂs banner reaching the ground at around 3.30pm.
A group of farmers from Tamil Nadu also arrived carrying skulls and bones to symbolise the suicides of their colleagues. The group threatened to go naked if they are not allowed to march to the Parliament on Friday.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are expecting a gathering of 35,000-40,000 people to march towards Parliament Street on Friday morning,Ã¢ÂÂ said Vijoo Krishnan, member of one of the many AIKSCC-affiliated bodies. In the night, food was served to the farmers at Ramlila Ground, where a cultural programme was also organised. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to reach the venue on Friday.

To make ends meet, his mother Poshamma, works as a farm hand in other farms. Nearly 95 per cent of his district lies in the drought-hit Krishna river basin, which has been experiencing a severe drought.
The demands of the farmers is passing of two bills seeking Ã¢ÂÂfreedom from indebtednessÃ¢ÂÂ and the Ã¢ÂÂright to guaranteed remunerative minimum support price (MSP)Ã¢ÂÂ, which were introduced in the Lok Sabha in August this year. In 2004, the National Commission for Farmers headed by MS Swaminathan submitted five reports, which contain a draft of recommendations that safeguarded the interest of farmers. The formation of national and state disaster relief commissions that can declare a region or a crop as distress-affected, and provide necessary relief, is also a demand.

Chandigarh, January 29

The state government is likely to let the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) notification, pertaining to villages surrounding Chandigarh, lapse. This would mean a windfall for land sharks, who have bought huge chunks in this ecologically fragile area in the Shivalik foothills, but are not allowed construction or groundbreaking under the 1900 Act.

The notification, issued by the Forests and Wildlife Department on February 3, 2003, will lapse on February 2. There is no move by the department to reissue the same. Instead, senior officials are asking developers to wait for February 3 for starting their projects.

A letter issued by the Chief Conservator of Forests (Hills) to project developers on January 22 says that the PLPA notification would cease to exist in February and they (developers) are free to undertake development activities for eco-tourism at Tarapur village.

In another letter, the officer has asked the developers to wait till August 28, when the PLPA notification for Karoran village would lapse (it was issued on January 20, 2004).

Top officers in the department told The Tribune that there was pressure from vested interests, who were backing colonisers/developers to ensure that the notification was not reissued. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had asked the state government not to reissue the notification Ã¢ÂÂmechanicallyÃ¢ÂÂ, rather first identify forest and non-forest areas and compensate landowners whose land was brought under the ambit of this Act. However, sources said the state had not done the exercise of identifying forest and non-forest areas in Ropar and Mohali districts.

Lapsing of the notification would mean that all malkiat land can be cleared of forest cover; and stone quarrying as well as tree felling would be allowed. Punjab, which has the lowest forest cover in India, will witness further depletion in its green cover. This land was brought under the PLPA as it was prone to soil erosion and the aim was to improve the water table in the Shivalik foothills. Twelve villages in Kharar, four in Ropar and 11 in adjoining areas of Nalagarh will be freed from provisions of the Act.

The announcement was made a day after AAPÃ¢ÂÂs Haryana state president Naveen Jaihind said that Kejriwal will extend support to protesting government employees in Karnal and address their rally to restore the old pension policy of government employees.
Ã¢ÂÂWe did not invite Kejriwal and we will not allow him to address the rally,Ã¢ÂÂ said Vijender Dhariwal, state president of the samiti.

Dhariwal said that some members of their union met Kejriwal and asked him to implement the old pension scheme in Delhi first if he really wants to support the government employees.
The members said that old pension policy provides social security to government employees after retirement but the new pension scheme does not give any such benefit to the employees.
The employeesÃ¢ÂÂ rally was being organised in KarnalÃ¢ÂÂs HUDA ground in Sector 12. On the other hand, in a press statement, Jaihind alleged that this was BJPÃ¢ÂÂs conspiracy as it was worried about the increasing popularity of Kejriwal in Haryana.

It, however, would not preclude officials from carrying out works such as survey of land and marking boundaries.

The judges chose to issue the direction after senior counsel N.L. Rajah, representing PMK Member of Parliament Anbumani Ramadoss, who had also filed a public interest litigation petition against the acquisition, brought to the notice of the court that most landowners were afraid of being dispossessed of their properties at any moment.

Though Advocate General Vijay Narayan told the court that acquisition proceedings were at a nascent stage and there was no imminent threat of anyone being dispossessed, the judges said, Ã¢ÂÂWe deem it appropriate that we clarify (through a direction) the aspect which has been placed before us by the learned Advocate General so that it will allay all fears.Ã¢ÂÂ Penning the interim order, Justice Sivagnanam said that such a direction had become necessary especially because pamphlets issued on behalf of the Kancheepuram Collector, explaining the salient features of the ambitious expressway project and the benefits that would ensue on its completion, did not contain any assurance that there was no immediate threat of dispossession.

Petition delinked

After passing the interim order, the judges delinked a PIL petition filed by G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal, a non-governmental organisation, from the batch of cases and began hearing it first, since it had challenged the constitutional validity of Section 105 of the Right to Fair Compensation in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.

The petitionerÃ¢ÂÂs counsel, M. Radhakrishnan, contended that Section 105 could not be allowed to remain in the statute book since it prevented all beneficial provisions of the legislation from being applied to acquisitions made for the purpose of national highways. He said it was unfair to deny rehabilitation and resettlement to those who parted with their lands for laying highways.

However, Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan and the Advocate General rebutted his arguments. They contended that Section 105 of the Act states that its provisions would not be applicable for acquisitions made for national highways alone but also for 12 other public purposes such as providing rail connectivity and supplying electricity.

When Parliament, in its wisdom, had thought it fit to keep acquisition of lands for certain public purposes out of the purview of the 2013 enactment to avoid unnecessary delays, it could not be said to be unfair, they contended. They also questioned the locus standi of the petitioner to challenge the legal provision and the acquisition proceedings for the expressway.

He also wanted corporate to step forward and make this vision a reality. Hindustan Zinc Mining Academy aligns with this mission and has all the elements of Skill-India.

Udaipur: Hindustan Zinc Mining Academy, perhaps the only mining academy, set-up by Hindustan Zinc, IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs only and worldÃ¢ÂÂs second largest Zinc producer saw 1st convocation of 150 students that includes 103 Jumbo Drill operators and 1st batch of 47 Winding Engine operators. The ceremony was held on 24th January 2018 in Udaipur and was attended by Arun Kumar-Secretary, Ministry of Mines Ã¢ÂÂ KP Krishnan-Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Ã¢ÂÂ Sunil Duggal-CEO, Hindustan Zinc & Chairman of Skill Council of Mining Sector Ã¢ÂÂR.K. Sharma-Secretary General Federation of Indian Mineral Industries Ã¢ÂÂ A.K. Bhandari-CEO, Skill Council for Mining Sector.

All the 150 pass-outs are ITI Diploma holders and this is the first time such convocation ceremony has been organized by a private sector company.

Hindustan Zinc has set-up Mining Academy at Bhilwara, Rajsamand and Zawar in Rajasthan, to meet the growing requirement of skilled manpower and generate employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas. The Mining Academy has been set-up in collaboration with Ã¢ÂÂSkill Council for Mining SectorÃ¢ÂÂ and training partner Ã¢ÂÂIndian Institute of Skill Development Pvt. LtdÃ¢ÂÂ. The Academy provides training to youths in Jumbo Drill Operations and Winding Engine Operations along with training in Banks-men and Bellman Operations.

The growth of mining in India has resulted in huge demands for skilled operators to operate sophisticated mining equipment such as jumbo drill, winding engine, load haul dumper (LHD), low profile dumper truck (LPDT), etc.

Speaking on the occasion Arun Kumar, Secretary Mines said, Ã¢ÂÂIn India, open-cast mining is more popular but rare minerals can only be found in underground mine. India is unable to find proper talent to operate the critical equipment of underground mines. Through this initiative of Hindustan Zinc, our youths will get employment opportunities in India and also in other International mines. Future is indeed very bright for these studentsÃ¢ÂÂ.

The Secretary M/O Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, KP Krishnan said developing skills of ITI Pass-outs in Mining industry is important and an extension of PMÃ¢ÂÂs Skill India Mission. When Skill-India mission was launched, HonÃ¢ÂÂble Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji had three important visions Ã¢ÂÂ Scale, Quality and Aspiration. He also wanted corporate to step forward and make this vision a reality. Through Ã¢ÂÂHindustan Zinc Mining AcademyÃ¢ÂÂ, all the elements of Skill-India have come together. Employment of high wages is proof of skills becoming aspirational. Organizing convocation for the 1st time for the ITI pass-outs is indeed commendable.

The CEO of Hindustan Zinc, Sunil Duggal, who is also the Chairman of Governing Board of Ã¢ÂÂSkill Council for Mining SectorÃ¢ÂÂ, stressed upon enhancing further skills of these pass-outs to match the international standards. Why call expats in the areas where we can train our own youth and make them employable. He also informed that these youths have already been placed in different companies and the demand is set to increase.

The Mining Academy pass-outs have already been placed with an average salary of Rs. 300,000 per annum. There has been 98% retention rate only proving that rural youth needs employability and they are ready to learn skills that can be used in the current sectors.

Pavan Kaushik the spokesperson of Hindustan Zinc informed that the Company started the Mining Academy on August 1, 2014 with a sole objective to train ITI pass-outs in mining related trades so that they can be employed within the company and also provide manpower to several mining companies operating in Rajasthan, to begin with. We are very proud that we have aligned with the vision and mission of Skill India and determined to increase our scale of training. Our initial target is 500 youths and we have so far trained 300 youths in Jumbo Drill and Winding engine operations.

Hindustan Zinc Mining Academy is a fully residential training program with provision for free boarding and lodging facilities for all the selected candidates in both the training programs. Along with practical training, 3-D simulator or training through virtual reality method is also provided to enhance their skills. Since it is a fully residential program, equal emphasis is given on soft skills, team effort, discipline, quality of life and overall personality development, which would further help them in securing sustainable livelihood in future.

The farmers, reeling from high fuel prices, were pressing for government help on Tuesday, their demands including higher support prices for agricultural goods, payment for pending sugarcane dues and waivers on farm loans ahead of elections due in 2019.
Marching from adjoining northern states, the farmers blocked one of the highways into New Delhi and used tractors to try and break through a police barrier, television pictures showed.
Some reportedly threw stones at police.

The protestors reached the outer limits of New Delhi on foot, in buses and on tractor trailers under the banner of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmers Union), a farmers group critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
Dharmendra Malik, a member of the union, told Al Jazeera that police fired ""tear gas and plastic bullets at unarmed farmers"". He claimed 50 people were injured.

The police could not be reached for comment immediately.
But earlier, Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Pankaj Singh defended the police decision to stop farmers from entering the national capital, saying it would create ""law and order situation"".
Elections are due in India next year and as votes approach, unions representing farmers and other groups have staged protests in an effort to secure sweeteners in exchange for support at the ballot box.
The farmers demonstrating on Tuesday were mostly from Uttar Pradesh (UP), India's most populous state with more than 200 million people and its most electorally important.
Abhimanyu Kohar, a farmer, condemned the police's actions against protesters and said farmers will continue their demonstration until their demands are met.
""There should be dialogue within a democracy. But this government is in a denial mode, they are unwilling to accept that there is a farm crisis. They will pay heavily in the upcoming elections for what they have done today,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) routed all opposition parties in UP in the last elections.
He remains personally popular according to several surveys, but after four years in power support for his party has been eroded by voter concerns about jobs and the spike in fuel prices.

178,1253,positive,"By Aditi Pinto Unseasonal rain and snowfall are impacting agriculture in Himachal Pradesh. Normal snowfall at the right time is beneficial to winter crops. It helps in root development, preventing soil from getting washed away and other benefits. Climate change is estranging mountain farmers from their lands, driving youth away from agriculture. There is a major need to amplify farmers' demands for monetary compensation and crop insurance. Unseasonal rain and snowfall is the main reason for agriculture failing in Himachal Pradesh. Ã¢ÂÂHailstorms or torrential rains are usually destructive to our crops while snowfall is not,Ã¢ÂÂ said Uma Devi of the Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, when speaking to Mongabay-India. However, the post-monsoon heavy snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, which came in two heavy spells in late September as well as early November 2018, were exceptions, and are now attributed to exacerbated climate change in the Himalayan region. Tourists were escaping the hot plains and flocking to the mountains to see snowfall. But the snowfall at this time of year was unexpected and is a calamity for the farming communities in these mountainous terrains. In the Lahaul district of Himachal Pradesh, located at around 3300 metres, snowfall in late September was disastrous for the summer crop of potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage as well as apples, pears, plums and cherries. Farmers of the district suffered a collective loss of more than Rs 300 million. The last time such untimely, heavy snowfall occurred was in 1955. In Jammu and Kashmir, the government has declared the early November snowfall as a natural calamity. Such heavy snowfall in these early months came as a total surprise and has not occurred in the last 20 years. In Doda, situated above 1500 metres in the Chenab valley, stories have emerged of destroyed maize crops as well as destruction to apple, walnut and persimmon orchards that were awaiting pruning in early December.

Late September was the time that pastoralists from the nomadic Gaddi tribe were to descend from the higher Dhauladhar mountains in the Kangra and Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh with their flocks of goats and sheep to begin their journey towards the Punjab region. This year, many shepherds were stuck, loss of life to cattle and horses were in the hundreds, and many awaited evacuation near the treacherous Bara Bhangal pass, at around 4000 metres, while the state responded to mainly foreign tourists stranded near Manali. Farmers demand compensation Ã¢ÂÂWhile the state government has offered a compensation of Rs 370 million for apple damage, so far there is no compensation on potato crop,Ã¢ÂÂ said Rakesh Chand of the Lahaul Potato GrowerÃ¢ÂÂs collective, a network of 2,000 potato growers. Ã¢ÂÂLahaul farmers are cut off from the rest of the state when the Rohtang pass closes, unlike Spiti which is still connected through Kinnaur. The livelihood of 80 percent of Lahaul relies on potato sales, for seed purposes to Gujarat and West Bengal and as food to the rest of the country. At this time potato farmers are protesting that the West Bengal state government has blocked their potato for seed purposes saying that there is an illness. We are asking that this blockade be lifted.Ã¢ÂÂ Untimely, snowfall has not just blocked the Rohtang road out to markets for pahadi (mountain-based) farmers, but also changed the reputation of their otherwise highly acknowledged crop. As farmers from Lahaul marched to the the district collectorÃ¢ÂÂs office to demand compensation, emergency compensation was sanctioned by the State Disaster Response Fund of Jammu & Kashmir. Mohammed Afzal Parray of the CPI (M) issued a statement saying that, Ã¢ÂÂThe government should provided compensation keeping in view the recurring losses to the farmers. A tree takes at least a decade to mature and the snowfall has ruined the hard work of years of farmers.Ã¢ÂÂ Farmers in the Kashmir Valley are now rallying for better crop insurance schemes. While compensation is the need of the hour, it is important in the context of climate change to not jump to a conclusion that snowfall is always destructive to agriculture. Instead, it is necessary to evaluate the historic connection between snowfall and agriculture, and furthermore the role that a rightly timed snowfall played in agriculture. The benefits of seasonal snowfall In the Kandbari village in Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh, which stands at around 1,400 metres above sea level, Balak Ram blissfully remembers snowfall. He says, Ã¢ÂÂIt used to snow and cover the base of the wheat crop. The snow protected the wheat from insects or rotting. It was only snowfall that didnÃ¢ÂÂt require us to spray our crops. Nowadays, given the lack of snow, we need to spray chemicals.Ã¢ÂÂ In the neighbouring Nain village, Roshan Lal shares that less snow means less nutrition for the wheat crop. Ã¢ÂÂIf snow falls between December and February, it is beneficial to our wheat and kidney bean crops. The seeds lie dormant, the roots develop, until the moment the snow melts and the seeds sprout. However, if it snows at the wrong time, it is very problematic.Ã¢ÂÂ According to scientists, normal snowfall at the right time is beneficial to winter crops in more ways than one. Snowfall of one foot, depending on the density, is equivalent to one inch of rain and provides a lot of moisture. Unlike rainfall, snow allows root development. Even when the top of the crop lies dormant, if the roots are well developed, the crop receives more nutrition. Furthermore, snow prevents the soil from being washed away with heavy rainfall and it has an insulating temperature, as it takes longer for moist soil to get cold than dry soil. In the Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, located at around 4,200 metres, Tsering Dawa Duni shares that Ã¢ÂÂthere is only one growing season as in this dry desert, the winters from December to March are too cold for agriculture. The main crops grown here are sorghum (jowar), other millets and green peas; pea is our major cash crop. Some farmers in lower Spiti who have begun to grow wheat and rice, grow both in the summer months.Ã¢ÂÂ As snow fell here in early November, the agricultural work had majorly wrapped up, yet the snowfall came as an early surprise and has cut out connectivity in the region.
Photo by Aditi Pinto
Duni said that there are two regions in Spiti (Upper and Lower) where the Lower is closer to Kaza (the city). Farmers in Spiti, particularly upper Spiti, are used to snowfall from late November onward. This year, it caught them by surprise, as it came earlier. For generations, villagers have dried vegetables and meat, depended on cheese and barley porridge to survive the winters. Other farmers, who live close to the city, depend on buying pulses and vegetables, and suffer much more with untimely climatic phenomena, as they cannot buy from anywhere and have no stock of food to rely on, he added. Climate change and agriculture in the Himalayas The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), located near Manali in Himachal Pradesh, has recorded that in the last 25 years, while rainfall has increased, snowfall has decreased. Their study, however, does not delve into untimely snowfall. Furthermore, the research shows that while in the northern Himalayan region overall, we can see a trend of global warming, the minimum temperatures have seen a sharp decrease. The change from seasonal rain and snow to flash storms and untimely snow has also meant the growth of pests in crops. The wheat crop in Himachal Pradesh currently has a huge aphid problem, aphids being a big sentinel of climate change. According to crop scientists at Palampur Krishi Vigyan Kendra, tuber crops which were always more hardy and resistant are also seeing a new pest in the form of the ""tuber moth"". Additionally, villagers of Rakkar, Kangra district shared that the majority of Himalayan farmers get their water for consumptive and irrigation use from glaciers. Snowfall that occurs at the right time of year, for example from late-November to February and in the right quantity, can also increase the stability of the glacier water system. Untimely snowfall in September-early November melts quickly, as the surrounding atmospheric temperatures are still relatively high and serves no real purpose. An ongoing study conducted by Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun shows that in farmers in Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand have stopped growing close to 30 traditional crops, including millets and local vegetables, owing to climate change. At the same time, the state government through Ã¢ÂÂclimate-sensitive agricultureÃ¢ÂÂ is encouraging farmers to grow off-season vegetables such as tomatoes, green peas, cauliflower so as to supply them to the plains areas. Additionally, given the decline of apple orchards, farmers are encouraged to grow tropical fruits such as kiwis, pomegranates and pineapples. All in all, this increases farmersÃ¢ÂÂ dependence on the market, which in times of climate change, means that farmers have less sovereignty, self-sufficiency and therefore are dependent on monetary economy.

They said 50 bighas of Nepali land has fallen into Indian territory after a Nepal-India joint survey team marked the positions for new subsidiary boundary pillars between main border posts 391 and 392 in Chhapkaiya area of Birgunj.

Local residents said they had long held legal ownership over the land, which now has fallen in the Indian Territory.

They claimed the positioning of new border pillars has moved up to 100 metres inside the Nepali territory.

They argued the land where they planted crops for generations was suddenly shown across the border.

They angry locals have begun a protest claiming that their properties have been encroached upon.

However, the authorities at the Survey Department in Kathmandu said that no Nepali land had reached India due to the positioning of the pillars.

The local landowners registered an application with the District Administration Office (DAO), claiming that their properties were being encroached upon in the name of border management.

Chief District Officer of Parsa Binod Prakash Singh said the chief of Nepali survey team had been notified about the issue.

An elephant that was part of a group hunting a man-eating tigress in western India ran astray overnight and trampled a woman to death, an official said Thursday.

The pachyderm was one of five elephants engaged in a search operation for a tigress that is suspected to have killed up to 13 people in Maharashtra state.

""The elephant left the base camp and travelled a distance of 20 kilometres in the night and killed a woman,"" forestry official A.K Mishra told AFP.

The elephant was later captured and all five animals were relieved of their duties, Mishra added.

The Indian Express newspaper said the victim was 35 years old.

The hunt for the tigress, who is being called Avni, which means earth in the local language, began after she was reported to have killed five villagers in the past year, Mishra said.

Officials suspect she may also have been responsible for another eight deaths stretching back to 2016, he added.

""Operations to hunt down the tiger and capture her cubs are on as per the Supreme Court directives,"" Mishra said.

The elephants were originally used by armed forest rangers who sat atop the animals as they entered thick forests inaccessible by vehicles.

Last month India's highest court dismissed appeals by activists that it intervene to stop the rangers from shooting dead Avni.

More than 9,000 people have signed a petition on Change.org calling for the tigress to be captured alive rather than killed.

Tigers do not generally attack humans, but some experts believe they can get a taste for human flesh once they have attacked once.

India is home to more than half of the world's tiger population with some 2,226 of the animals roaming its reserves, according to the last count in 2014.

Dozens die every year, sometimes at the hands of poachers, while reports of man-animal conflict are not uncommon. Wildlife activists say they occur when humans encroach into tiger corridors.

The Ã¢ÂÂdoubling of farmersÃ¢ÂÂ income (DFI)Ã¢ÂÂ initiative of the Union government has brought many pending reforms agenda into focus. NITI AayogÃ¢ÂÂs policy paper on DFI and the published volumes of the committee on DFI of ministry of agriculture and farmersÃ¢ÂÂ welfare have stressed on institutional and governance reforms as important components of governmentÃ¢ÂÂs strategies to raise income of farmers in the country. Unfortunately, two of the very important policies on agriculture marketing and land leasing have often been talked about in policy circles, but are yet to see complete adoption or effective implementation.

The government-appointed committee has clearly outlined that the DFI objective has to be achieved over a period of seven years (not five as often perceived) by taking 2015-16 as the base year. It is pertinent to further note that the government objective on DFI is to raise Ã¢ÂÂreal incomeÃ¢ÂÂ and not, Ã¢ÂÂnominal incomeÃ¢ÂÂ of farmers. Studies have now revealed that a CAGR of 10.4% would be needed to achieve the desired target by 2022-23 (the present level of CAGR computed from 2002-03 to 2012-13 being only 3.5%). States like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Odisha have shown real-CAGR growth in farmersÃ¢ÂÂ income beyond 5% in the referred period, Odisha having the highest of 8.3%. It is therefore not impossible to achieve DFI with a conducive policy environment and sincere implementation of the schemes and programmes.

The DFI committee report further estimates that an additional investment of `6.4 lakh crore (at 2011-12 prices) would be needed for agriculture sector till 2022. These additional investments are beyond the amounts given as subsidies (on fertilisers, power, water, etc) and loan waivers in few states. The extra investments are expected to be pumped in from both public sector and private enterprises (including farmers). A substantial share of these extra funds has to come from the government, both Centre and states (for creation of infrastructure like irrigation, roads, energy, etc, that support agricultural growth). The private sector investment has to come from the farmers themselves. Corporate sector contributions from agri-business entities and CSR funds of PSUs or private companies would come, but canÃ¢ÂÂt meet the humongous demand.

There have been ample studies which have suggested direct linkages between tenure security and food security (Holden et al, 2016). Weak land rights lead to tenure insecurity that ultimately results in reduced land productivity because of poor land management and land degradation. Alternatively, ensuring land rights through a legal framework incentivises the cultivators (lessees/tenants/share croppers) to invest (and also conserve) in the land resources. Tenure security of cultivated land is thus an essential intervention to enhance food security. In the Indian context, research institutions/think tanks and economists have been often suggesting to legalise land leasing to attract investments from the cultivators and, thus, improve agricultural efficiency. Lease farming is now conclusively recognised as an Ã¢ÂÂeconomic necessityÃ¢ÂÂ and no more a symbol of Ã¢ÂÂfeudal agrarian structureÃ¢ÂÂ that India inherited after Independence.

Land revenue, records as well as agriculture are state subjects. The legislations on land revenue matters including land leasing are diverse and complex across the states. While there is no legal ban on leasing in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Rajasthan, it is totally banned without any exception in Kerala. In Odisha, leasing out agricultural land is banned except by a person under disability or under a privileged raiyat. While laws governing land leasing in Indian states vary relating to restrictions, period of lease, tenant rights regulation on rent, etc, studies show that all these restrictive land-leasing legislations have led to informal or concealed tenancy without security of tenure. The land reform laws passed by state governments immediately after Independence aimed at abolition of intermediaries (under Zamindari, Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems), abolition of regulation of tenancy and redistribution of ceiling surplus lands, wherever applicable. However, all these reform measures could not impact the rural transformation positively as envisaged. Studies have established that insecure and informal tenancy adversely affected cultivatorsÃ¢ÂÂ access to institutional credit, insurance and other support services. It is indeed alarming that 10-20% of cultivable land remains fallow across the country. Occupational mobility of landowners (potential land-lessors in a sound policy framework) is often suggested to absorb surplus workforce from primary sector into other employment opportunities. However, this desired objective has never been met in a restricted land-leasing regime, as fear of losing the land continues even today if the landowners lease their own lands (even after having record of rights) and migrate out for other activities. All these factors compound the non-realisation of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs agri-potential.

Recommendations of the T Haque committee on land-leasing are very timely. The committee has suggested a model agricultural land-leasing law for adoption by the states. Unfortunately, the response of state governments has been very lukewarm thus far. In fact, these suggested reforms to legalise and liberalise land leasing would address many critical issues (much-needed investments in farm lands, insurance against risks like weather, etc) in a changing climate era. Interestingly, the model law does not specify the rent on leased land and the period of lease and has left it to the individual parties in the land-lease market (land-owner lessor and lessee cultivator) without any interference from the government.

Evidences from micro-level studies by the International Food Policy Research Institute indicate that closing gender gaps in agriculture not only helps advancing gender equality, but also affects agricultural productivity positively. Studies have shown that inclusion of women as co-owners lead to Ã¢ÂÂimproved security of tenure, agricultural investments and womenÃ¢ÂÂs involvement in food and agricultural decisionsÃ¢ÂÂ. It will be progressive to recognise womenÃ¢ÂÂs land rights while taking forward the land reforms agenda.

While concealed tenancy is prevalent across the states, any further delay in legalising land leasing will impact agricultural efficiency, thanks to the want of private investments. Any meaningful decision on such a sensitive subject could only be possible if all the state governments are on board. There cannot be a meaningful outcome in the agriculture sector without active involvement and participation of the relevant departments/ministries of both the Union and the state governments. A meeting, at the level of NITI Aayog (chaired by the prime minister with state chief ministers and other experts in attendance), must discuss all such governance/agricultural reforms issues and prepare state-/region-specific strategies to achieve the DFI. Alternatively, a meeting of the National Development Council can also be convened to discuss the matter. This will not only bring seriousness amongst the policy makers at the highest level, but also instil confidence in the minds of 140 million agricultural households of India.

The big cat was blamed for killing more than a dozen people and its shooting capped off one of India's most high-profile tiger hunts in decades.
The months-long pursuit had already proven controversial, with animal activists unhappy a celebrated hunter had been recruited to shoot the mother of two cubs.
A member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet accused the state forest minister of acting illegally, and vowed to take legal action over the ""ghastly murder"" of the tiger.
India established a national tiger authority in 2006 and bolstered anti-poaching laws to protect tiger numbers.

Instead she thinks of trapped, chased and dying herds.

She thinks of the Numaligarh makhna, an elephant so perplexed by the wall erected along his traditional route in Assam that he tried to bring it down and died of a brain hemorrhage. Or the Athgarh herd, islanded in a mosaic of villages and fields in Odisha, and subjected to the taunts of mobs of drunken men each evening. She thinks of the Dharamjaigarh mother and unborn calf, who hit the ground with the impact of an earthquake, after she was electrocuted by high-voltage wires strung across a field in Chhattisgarh.

When Bindra thinks about elephant watching, itÃ¢ÂÂs no longer of mornings spent on safari, marvelling at the mammoth beasts engaged in play and social interactions. What comes to mind are the distraught men and women in anonymous Indian villages. She thinks of Sumitra bai and Bhuvan Dhanwar, trampled beyond recognition in Chhattisgarh. She thinks of elephant tracker Panchanan Nayak stoically following OdishaÃ¢ÂÂs Athgarh herd and warning villagers of their path, all the while risking his life. She thinks of a crowd of locals in West Bengal placing flowers on the body of an elephant hit by a speeding train.

India has the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest population of wild Asian elephants. It also has a colossal human-elephant conflict problem, one that claims dozens of lives every year. Unlike tiger reserves, elephant reserves have no legal sanctity, and by some accounts a mere 22% of elephant habitat is safeguarded within IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Protected Areas of sanctuaries, national parks and conservation reserves. Elephants and humans are being forced to live in uneasy proximity, as cities and townships expand, railways and roads cut across wildernesses, and forests shrink and fragment.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a pressing problem with a high death toll that finds little sympathy in urban corridors of power. Beyond declaring the elephant as IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs National Heritage Animal, fixing meagre compensation amounts for crops, property and human life, and establishing the ineffectual Project Elephant (an embarrassing sibling to the relatively successful Project Tiger), elephant conservation and conflict mitigation has been broadly left to field staff, individual activists and non-governmental organisations.

However, it evoked only superficial promises of action from the Odisha government and the herdÃ¢ÂÂs status remains the same. Photo credit: Karan Tejpal

In May, frustrated by the absence of a scientific and humane approach to deal with human-elephant conflict, Bindra filed a public interest litigation against the states of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Karnataka. In it, she cited their failure to protect elephants, and their participation in activities that are in direct contravention of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

From the installation of metal spikes to hinder elephant movement in Karnataka, to the state-sanctioned hullah parties in West Bengal who chase away elephants by propelling burning sacks and sticks in their direction, state action in human-elephant conflict mitigation has been largely unscientific and reactionary. Through the petition, Bindra sought to Ã¢ÂÂstop this state sponsored torture of wild animals across the nation in the name of mitigating human-wildlife conflictÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ Her larger purpose was to seek protection for elephant habitats and corridors, which are crucial to the long-term survival of this endangered species.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed grief over the killing of Inspector Subodh Kumar and promised a speedy investigation into the matter, which has triggered a major outrage and political bickering.
The state government on Tuesday ordered a probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by an Inspector General of Police (IGP), to probe all aspects related to the incident.
Subodh Kumar was killed in the violence took place after the carcasses of 25 cattle were found in the forests close to a police post, with the locals alleging that those belonged to cows slaughtered illegally.
A local youth was also killed in the violence.
""Four people have been arrested. I don't know about the organizations (responsible for the violence) yet, but the main accused in the violence is Yogesh Raj who has not been arrested till now,"" Additional Director General (Law & Order) Anand Kumar said while addressing a press conference.
According to sources, post mortem conducted on Subodh Kumar confirms gunshot injury by .32 mm bore bullet on his head.
Additional DG (Meerut Zone) Prashant Kumar said an SIT has been formed under IG Range Meerut.
He said the SIT will probe different aspects, such as how the incident occurred, why the mob got violent, how many people were there with the Inspector and whether anyone flee from the spot. ""Action will be taken if any laxity is found,"" Prashant Kumar said.
Police have lodged two FIRs, one into the alleged cattle slaughter and the other into the violent protests which followed.
At least 27 people have been named by the police in the FIR into the violent protests, It also mentions 60 unnamed people allegedly involved in the violence, the police said.
A bullet has been recovered from the body of local youth Sumit, who also died in the violence yesterday, Anand Kumar said.
The final post-mortem report will ascertain the bore of the bullet, the ADG added.
ADG (Intelligence) SP Shirodkar visited the violence-hit area on Tuesday and said ""We'll submit a report tomorrow evening.""
Meanwhile, Subodh Kumar's sister Saroj Singh Chauhan alleged a conspiracy behind the killing of her brother.
""My brother has been killed because he was investigating the Akhlaq murder case. This is a conspiracy,"" she told ANI.
Akhlaq was lynched by a mob in Dadri area of Uttar Pradesh in September 2015 over suspicion of cow slaughter.
""Why was my brother alone in his vehicle? Police are complacent in its role in the incident,"" Saroj charged.
The police vehicle in which Subodh Kumar was killed was charred in the incident.
Targeting Yogi Adityanath, Saroj Chauhan said, ""What is this 'gai-gai' (cow protection) our Chief Minister keeps uttering all the time? Why doesn't he come onto the ground and serve the cause of cow protection? Today, I have lost my brother because of a cow!""
She demanded that her brother be declared a martyr and a memorial be built for him since he died in the line of duty.
""What good is the 50,000 or 50 lakh rupees for us? We will return it. We want a martyr memorial in our village. I need nothing except honour for my brother,"" she added.
She informed that the deceased cop's father too was a policeman and had died in a similar incident when he was shot dead.
The slain cop's wife said justice would be done only when his killers are killed.
""He worked with complete honesty and took all the responsibility on himself. This is not the first incident. He suffered bullet injury twice before. But now nobody is giving him justice. Justice will be done only if his killers are killed,"" the wailing wife said.
Governor Ram Naik described yesterday's incident as condemnable and said the Chief Minister has ordered a probe.
""Whatever may be the reason, such incidents can't be allowed,"" he added.
""I hope the truth will be out in 2 days as he (CM) said strict action will be taken against those who committed this crime,"" Naik said.
The Opposition parties used the incident to slam the Yogi Adityanath-led government.
""It's a shocking state of affairs how a mob killed a police officer investigating the Akhlaq case,"" Congress leader Kapil Sibal said.
Attacking the UP Chief Minister, the former union minister said, ""Instead of taking care of his state, Yogi is going to Telangana and spewing venom.""
BSP leader and former UP Chief Minister Mayawati alleged that there was ""jungle raj"" in the state.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs 150 poorest but mineral-rich districts could get a major facelift in the next one year, coinciding with the 2019 general elections, provided the state governments are able to spend over ~18,800 crore they have from mining companies under the district mining fund.

The fund was created through an amendment in the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 by the National Development Alliance government, taking forward the idea first mooted by the United Progressive Alliance government when a new version of the mineral law was proposed.

The Centre, through a notification in January 2015, had asked the states to set up a district mineral foundation trust to share mining revenue.

For major minerals such as coal, bauxite, chromite, iron ore and manganese, the companies were required to share 10% to 30% of the royalty with the foundation. In case of minor minerals such as building stones, gravel and limestone, the state governments were given the power to decide the amount of royalty to be shared.

In over two years, mineral-rich states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, where half of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs economically and socially backward districts are located, contributed about 75% to the fund worth ~18,867 crore, which meant about one-fourth of total development funds for the mineral rich districts, till the first week of May.

The money is to be utilised under the national scheme called Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra being monitored by the mines ministry.

As per the guidelines, around 60% of the funds are to be used for big-ticket projects on drinking water, healthcare, education, environment and sanitation.

The remaining can be used for providing energy access, watershed management and irrigation.

However, the pace of spending the money has not been satisfactory. According to the mines ministry, projects worth ~8,579 crore have been approved but the expenditure till the first week of May was only 20%. The mines ministry is concerned about the slow pace of work.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have asked state governments to utilise money for two or three big schemes so that utilisation of the money improves and there is visible impact on the ground,Ã¢ÂÂ said a senior mines ministry official familiar with the matter.

The directive came after an analysis by the ministry showed that the states flush with funds were allocating the money to a large number of small projects. For instance, Chhattisgarh has started 51,686 projects, Odisha around 42,899 and Jharkhand 2,07,173 Ã¢ÂÂ the majority of which is for declaring villages open defecation free (ODF).

Mines minister Narendra Singh Tomar at a recent review meeting asked the state governments to ensure that around 60% of the funds should be used to improve the lives of people through drinking water supply, imparting skills to youth for jobs in the local industry and building new school and healthcare facilities. Following the direction, officials say, some districts such as Dhanbad, a highly polluted coal mining district in Jharkhand, has allocated 62.5% of its fund for clean drinking water.

But the overall expenditure is about 20% of the money collected and the work from the fund is yet to start in the six districts of Garhwa, Khunti, Simdega, Jamtara, Dumka and Sahebganj, admit Jharkhand government officials familiar with the matter.

JharkhandÃ¢ÂÂs mines director SI Minz said the funds are directly allocated to the districts and the deputy commissioners are accountable for the expenditure. Ã¢ÂÂWe in the headquarters only receive the figures related to fund allocations and expenditures besides some details regarding work outlays,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.

In OdishaÃ¢ÂÂs Kendujhar, the entire education budget has been used for the construction of additional classrooms.

The state has also planned to build a medical college in Keonjhar and a flyover in Joda from the fund, but starting work on these projects is taking time. Just 11% of ~4,453 collected has been utilised till May this year.

OdishaÃ¢ÂÂs chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi, who supervises the fund at the state level, said they expect the pace of the work to pick up as the detailed project report of most of the big-ticket projects under DMF have been cleared.

Ã¢ÂÂGetting a source of water in rural pipe water supply project is tricky and takes up a lot of time,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Chhattisgarh has approved about 51,686 projects spread across sectors such as drinking water supply, environment preservation, pollution control, health and education, among others and 60% of ~2,746 crore generated has been used, which is a high among all states.

Two Chhattisgarh districts Ã¢ÂÂ Korba and Maoist-affected Dantewada Ã¢ÂÂ stand out as they have the highest rate (about 85%) of completing the projects in a short span of time. States mining secretary Subodh Singh said: Ã¢ÂÂOur progress in using the DMF funds is best in the country and Chhattisgarh is a role model for many states.Ã¢ÂÂ

In election-bound Rajasthan, the government has not been able to utilise even 20% of the money collected.

According to mines department, only 120 crore of the ~594 crore has been used so far. A secretary in the department said work was slow in almost all the 33 districts as district officials have failed to hold regular meetings on fund utilisation.

According to a study done by the Centre for Science and Environment, the slow pace of fund utilisation was primarily because of least progress with respect to developing district management plans except for a few key mining districts in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.

Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of Centre for Science and Environment said: Ã¢ÂÂThe district mining fund has huge potential to benefit poor locals in the mining areas. But the money is being spent without much scientific and contemplative planning. The districts need to identify the priority areas and ensure that the projects are completed in a time-bound manner.Ã¢ÂÂ

The mines ministry official quoted above said that the states have assured that all the ongoing projects will be completed by the end of the current financial year, which is March 2019, a month before the general elections.

Voices of protest

Rana Sengupta, managing trustee and CEO of the Rajasthan Mine Labour Protection Campaign Trust, said the government is only duplicating the fund spend.

Ã¢ÂÂThe different departments already had sufficient funds. The government is diverting funds for welfare of mining workers.Ã¢ÂÂ

He suggested that the government should set up a mine workers welfare board on the lines of the building and other construction workersÃ¢ÂÂ board. Ã¢ÂÂThis will benefit not only the mine workers but also ensure their votes to the government,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

According to Haru Rajwar, a resident of Lodna in Dhanbad, the administration chalked out several toilets under the ODF scheme, but Ã¢ÂÂonly a few are operational for want of water,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Odisha claimed that the money was being allocated to small projects to benefit the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) cadre, a charge denied by the ruling party.

198,1384,positive,"Chandigarh (Haryana), [India], December 28 (ANI): The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to explain why they had duped the poster boy of its promised loan waiver scheme - Budh Singh and lakhs of Punjab farmers by promising 'karja kurki khatam' but refused to implement the same for nearly two years now.
Former Cabinet Minister in the Punjab Government and SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said that by betraying the solemn promise made to Budh Singh that his loan would be the first loan to the waived off, both Rahul Gandhi and Captain Amarinder, who had authored the scheme and assured its implementation respectively, had committed a crime against humanity.
""They have collectively destroyed the lives of lakhs of farmers and have driven hundreds to suicide. Still, they are unmoved by the misery of the farmers and are refusing to honour the pledge made to Budh Singh as well as all other farmers of the State. It was unfortunate that after destroying the Punjab peasantry, Rahul Gandhi had promised a similar fraudulent loan waiver scheme to farmers of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh,"" he asserted.
Terming the present plight of the Punjab peasantry as a tragedy beyond compare, Majithia said Captain Amarinder had as Pradesh Congress president stood beside Budh Singh of Dera Baba Nanak constituency and used him as the poster boy of the Congress party's 'karja kurki khatam, fasal ki puri rakam' loan waiver scheme. He said Budh Singh and scores of other farmers across the State had voted for the Congress party in the 2017 elections after Capt Amarinder Singh uploaded a video promising them a complete loan waiver of Rs 90,000 crore covering nationalized and cooperative banks as well as private money lenders. ""Two years have passed since this promise. The entire farming community feels cheated. More than 500 farmers have ended their lives when like Budh Singh their loans multiplied because they stopped paying instalments in the hope for of an early waiver. The government, however, remained unmoved by the plight of the peasantry and even refused to give jobs to family members of suicide victims"".
Asserting that he had raised the issue of the suffering of Budh Singh in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha also one year back, Majithia said he had been assured that the farmer's loan would be waived off. ""Apparently the Congress government is in the habit of lying in the sacred Vidhan Sabha also"", he said, adding the government had not only failed to implement the promised loan waiver but had also started 'kurki' proceedings against farmers. He further said that a notice was also posted on the door of Budh Singh's house in Kotli Surat Mali in Gurdaspur district. ""Same is the case with other farmers, with recovery (kurki) proceedings being initiated against them despite lies by the Congress in the Vidhan Sabha that no 'kurki' was being done against farmers,"" he added.
Stating that farmers in Punjab were facing the worst crisis ever, the Akali leader said they had not been paid for crop damage for more than one year now. He stated that paddy farmers had suffered huge losses due to Congress government's dictatorial order delaying paddy transplantation by ten days, which resulted in low yields and high moisture content in food grain forcing farmers to pay bribes of Rs 100 to Rs 150 per quintal to get their paddy procured.
Majithia said sugarcane farmers had not been paid Rs 400 crore dues pending since one year besides being offered the lowest procurement rate in Northern India. ""Recently potato farmers have suffered crippling losses but the government has failed to come out with a relief package to save them from ruin. Punjab has not witnessed such an anti-farmer government ever"", he added. (ANI)","SAD slams Rahul Gandhi, Amarinder for betraying farmers"

The farmers, who converged at Ramlila Ground here and will march to Parliament Street on Friday, came from different corners of the country, including Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.
Traffic was disrupted in many parts of the city as they marched to Ramlila Ground in the heart of the city on four different routes -- starting at the Anand Vihar, Nizamuddin and Bijwasan railway stations and at Sabzi Mandi.
Banded under the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), which claims to be an umbrella body of 207 organisations of farmers and agricultural workers, many of the farmers came in trains and other packed into buses and other modes of transport.
Those from Delhi and nearby Punjab and Haryana started collecting around 10.30 am, their leaders said. Kamla, a functionary of the All India Kisan Sabha's Delhi unit, said farmers from nearby areas converged at Majnu Ka Tila on the outskirts of Delhi from where they marched in groups to Ramlila Maidan.

About 1,200 members of the South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturalists Association reached the capital in the early hours of Thursday carrying skulls of two of their colleagues who had committed suicide, their leader P Ayyakannu claimed.
The group from Tamil Nadu threatened to march naked if they are not allowed to go to Parliament on Friday. Last year, the group staged protests at Jantar Mantar with the skulls of eight farmers who killed themselves owing to farm losses. The two-day rally will be one of the largest congregations of farmers in Delhi, the AIKSCC has claimed.
At Ramlila Maidan, it was a sea of red as farmers wearing caps and flags gathered, with some of them arriving here after completing a long journey of as long as 36 hours. The Maidan resonated with slogans of 'Ayodhya nahi, Karzi maaf chahiye (We dont need Ayodhya but debt waiver'.
All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) leader Atul Anjaan said Delhi Jal Board will provide them water tanks and AAP local MLAs will give food packets.
Five Gurdwaras in the Delhi region have extended their help to the farmers. Bangla Sahib Gurdwara, Sisganj Sahib, Rakabganj, Bap Sahib and Manju Ka Tila will provide accommodation to farmers for the night, he said.
However, majority of the farmers will stay at Ramlila Maidan in tents, he said.
The leader also said that AAP volunteers have put up tents in large numbers at Anand Vihar station for farmers who arrived there and are also providing snacks and water to them. Some students from Delhi University have also arrived at the maidan and are helping farmers out.
Vounteers, including doctors, lawyers, professors and artists, all came out in large numbers to help. Around 600-700 volunteers of a solidarity group Nation For Farmers marched with the farmers from four assembly points -Bijwasan, Majnu Ka Tila, Nizamuddin and Anand Vihar towards Ramlila Maidan.
Under their campaign, Dilli Chalo, they mobilised support for the march. A cultural programme was held at Ramlila Ground in the evening.
The AIKSCC was formed under the aegis of All India Kisan Sabha and other Left affiliated farmers' bodies in June 2017, after protests by farmers in states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh for debt relief and remunerative prices.
Police said they have made elaborate arrangements for the rally on Friday, when the farmers will begin their march from Ramlila Ground to Parliament Street.
Support for the farmers poured in with activists taking to Twitter to ask the general public to join the march.
""Women farmers greet us this morning from Bijwasan as they are all set to embark on #KisanMuktiMarch. Join us even if you are not a farmer. Join the hands that toil to feed us. Jai Kisan!,"" tweeted political activist and former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.
Lawyer Prashant Bhushan also tweeted in solidarity with farmers.""Over 3L farmers have committed suicide in India in last 15 yrs, due to successive govts betraying them. Tomorrow 100,000 farmers from across the country are marching to Delhi to ask for fair prices & freedom from debt. Let's stand in solidarity with them,"" he said.
Jamun Thakur, a farmer from Parri village of Bihar's Darbhanga district, said he arrived in the city at 8 am Thursday with over 2,000 farmers mostly associated with AIKS. They started their journey on the Bihar Samprakranti Express on Wednesday morning.

200,1388,positive,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A senior police officer and another man were killed on Monday in violent protests over reports of a slaughtered cow, an animal sacred in Hindu culture, in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Uttar Pradesh state.
A crowd angered over what they believed was the slaughter of the cow threw stones and torched vehicles outside a police station. The officer died from gunshot wounds, district magistrate Anuj Jha told Reuters.
Earlier, police had said the officer was stoned to death and the other man died from gunshot wounds.

201,1389,positive,"In 2010 an organisation I was working with held a conference on water issues. The rhetoric on the Indus was being tapped by militant organisations, and it was in the interest of both India and Pakistan to encourage some dialogue on the issues involved before it became unmanageable. One scene from that conference stands out in my mind. One of our Pakistani guests Ã¢ÂÂ a water expert himself Ã¢ÂÂ said, Ã¢ÂÂYou have no idea what we are struggling with. Do you realise that in my city (I forget now whether he was referring to Karachi or Lahore) we have water for only two hours a day?Ã¢ÂÂ

One of the Indians at the table coughed, and said quietly, Ã¢ÂÂThat is about how much water we get in Delhi as well.Ã¢ÂÂ

That conversation was an icebreaker. It suddenly reconceptualised the discussions we were having at a very human level. It also brought home to all of us how little we knew about the challenges being faced by people living in the same region.

Too often talk on water between Indians and Pakistanis is reduced to discussing the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, how it works, and how it fails. It is easy to understand why this is the case because the vast majority of fresh water in Pakistan is supplied by the rivers of the Indus Basin. Since these rivers flow through the Indian states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab before arriving in Pakistan, any drop in water levels, and consequent water shortage is easily seen as an India-Pakistan issue.

The reality is far more complex. Rivers are too often seen as mere carriers of water, glorified canals that transport water from one place to another, instead of being seeing as large, complex ecosystems that can be affected in a multiplicity of ways. Part of the problem is the Treaty itself. By its very nature it is a creation of its time, when engineering solutions were seen as the acme of achievement. More importantly, as those who have studied the history of the Treaty know, it is not the ideal that was imagined when the negotiations began.

In his book, Indus Divided: India, Pakistan and the River Basin Dispute, published in 2017, Daniel Haines does a great job in situating the creation of the treaty in the tense atmosphere of post-Independence and post-Partition days. And yet, despite the first war between the two countries, this was also the time when the Nerhu-Liaquat Pact was worked out, when the two countries did try to find some modus vivendi vis-Ã -vis each other. People on both sides of the border forget that it was only after the 1965 war that the borders hardened, and visas became requirements, unlike before where travel could be done on domicile documents (as was attempted in allowing Cross-Line of Control travel after 2005 in Kashmir.) Nevertheless the times were not suitable to push through a treaty that would allow joint maintenance of the basin, or at least the part of the basin in the two countries. Therefore the Treaty remains a treaty of divorce, with one set of rivers managed by India, and the other Ã¢ÂÂ except for certain specific and limited usage strictly defined in the Treaty Ã¢ÂÂ for the use of Pakistan.

Nor is the Treaty perfect. No treaty ever is. It is the nature of such agreements to leave all sides somewhat unhappy, since that is still better than no treaty, great unhappiness, and no mechanism to resolve the issues that may crop up. Within these broad parameters the Treaty works, because it continues to serve the self-interest of both countries within very strict bounds.

The problems arise from both external and internal factors. The external factors are, in a sense, easy to list. The first, and foremost, of these is the lack of China and Afghanistan as signatories to the Treaty despite having part of the Indus Basin in their territory. This is a problem more for Pakistan than for India, as the large part of the catchment area is not in China. Furthermore Afghanistan is upstream only to Pakistan, and thus India is not affected by its water usage directly Ã¢ÂÂ unlike Pakistan. Nevertheless it makes the holistic treatment of the Indus Basin as a single unit impossible from within the Treaty. The Treaty has the space to try and build on this, but it is unlikely that the current geopolitical realities would be conducive to create such an opportunity.

The second external factor that affects the Indus Basin is also beyond the control of India and Pakistan, and that is climate change. The key outcomes of climate change: disruption of weather patterns leading to more frequent and more intense floods and droughts, as well as higher than average temperatures, are going to be with us no matter what we do. Unfortunately, given how massive an impact it is having in the Himalayan region, there are very few organisations Ã¢ÂÂ with the exception of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) Ã¢ÂÂ that are focussed on what is happening. This means that as the Himalayas as a whole change in character, affecting the largest concentration of ice and snow on the planet after the North and South Poles, the countries in the region are only focussed on what is happening within their borders, and unable to accurately predict changes, or reasonably deal with them.

In 2014 a massive downpour in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir led to huge losses and killed hundreds. Inevitably these rushing waters, and massive downpour, impacted Pakistan too, causing havoc and also killing hundreds. No dynamic flood control mechanism exists across these territories, costing both countries massive damage in both lives and wealth, often impacting the most marginalised communities the most. While the countries cannot control the outcome of climate change, they do have the power to cooperate on dealing with the impacts. But once again, political realities seem to outweigh the practical consequences of non-cooperation.

Focussing on external issues, though, may obscure what is closer to the ground and easier to fix. One of the main challenges for water usage across South Asia, and especially in India and Pakistan, is the water intense form of agriculture. In both these countries most of the water, around 80%, is devoted to growing crops. More importantly much of this water is simply wasted. Both of these countries use a form of rice cultivation in which the crop is grown in standing water, and much of this water simply evaporates. More problematically, large amounts of water are transported through leaky canal structures over long distances, evaporating on the way, and ending up diverting far more water than is actually needed to grow the crops.

Part of the problem remains unequal access to water, and so Sindh Ã¢ÂÂ the province in Pakistan that has the best and oldest water distribution system Ã¢ÂÂ ironically has some of the worst human development parameters in the country. Similarly, across various states of India, the provenance of free electricity to farmers has driven a massive increase in the installation of water pumps that pull up groundwater to irrigate the fields. With the irregular rainfall brought on by climate change, and complicated access to water through canals, farmers are drawing out as much water as they can, often far beyond the natural capacity for this groundwater to recharge. As the water levels plummet, not only do the poorer farmers Ã¢ÂÂ who cannot afford to dig deeper Ã¢ÂÂ suffer, but the minerals in the water, including dangerous ones like arsenic, become concentrated.

To add to these water problems, the greed for land Ã¢ÂÂ whether as farmland or as living space Ã¢ÂÂ means that the natural and artificial water bodies that would sustain the water levels, such as lakes, marshlands, and small ponds, have been almost wiped out. This makes it harder for water to filter through into the ground below to recharge aquifers, and during droughts, it makes it harder for marginal farmers to survive. In cities, though, it has another drastic effect as lake and riverbeds are built over. One of the lessons of the tragic 2014 floods was that they were supercharged not just by excessive rain over a very short period, but that mismanaged urbanisation in Srinagar meant that there was nowhere for the water to flow, except into inhabited areas Ã¢ÂÂ with catastrophic effects.

Lastly, but certainly not the least important, is the issue of solid waste management, primarily non-biodegradable plastics. In a series of features we did documenting the cities in the Himalayan region Ã¢ÂÂ including Peshawar, Karachi, Srinagar, Kathmandu, Dhaka, Thimphu, and the Qinghai plateau in ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs Tibetan region Ã¢ÂÂ it was striking how common the issues were. Across the Himalayan region Ã¢ÂÂ with Bhutan being a little of an exception Ã¢ÂÂ plastic was everywhere. Much of it was clogging up drains. There were few examples of sewage plants working the way they had been envisaged. It is little surprise, then, that the most polluted rivers are in Asia, and that these rivers are dying across the region.

an urban forest project in Karachi and Lahore , which was, in turn, both inspired and assisted by, an Indian Ã¢ÂÂ who had, in turn, gotten the initial idea from a Japanese colleague. One of PakistanÃ¢ÂÂs great successes in its mountainous regions has been micro hydroelectric projects. Small units, maintained by local communities, these have provided a regular and cheap source of electricity to communities far from the national grid, and relatively free from the problems of load-shedding. As India deals with the economic and environmental problems of large hydropower projects Ã¢ÂÂ many of them abandoned as being unviable due to financial issues, this example is one that it can learn from . In both India and Pakistan young children have petitioned the Supreme Courts of their country to look after their future, one which will be devastating if carbon-heavy forms of development take preponderance.

One of the successes that Imran Khan, as the new Prime Minister of Pakistan, can claim from his partyÃ¢ÂÂs leadership in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the Billion Tree Tsunami, in which his party the PTI made reforestation a priority. Tree cover in a mountainous region helps manage temperatures, prevent landslides, and retain topsoil, which, in turn, helps the soil retain moisture and help recharge water tables. In India, poor farmers dealing with climate change became part of a 100 village project in 2010, shifting beyond mono-cropping, learning to deal with vagaries of the weather, and making a profit.

The problem with discussing water on an inter-governmental level is that the issues discussed sometimes lose sight of the lives of the common citizens of both countries who stand to lose, or benefit. Rightly or wrongly, the Indus Waters Treaty will dominate the discussion on water when the countries discuss issues at the highest levels, but it is at best a limited lens to deal with the massive challenges that both countries face. Given that so much of our agricultural, political and social systems are alike, it would make sense to broaden the conversation, to try and understand what is happening across the whole basin, both the good and the bad. And, as in so many things, the people are ahead of the leaders, as they read the news, and pick up innovations that are taking place in towns they have only heard of.

If only the governments helped take these discussions forward, made it easier for people from both countries to meet, exchange ideas, and innovate together, imagine how far we might go.

In the ecologically sensitive state of Uttarakhand, there has been a continuing effort to make the Chota Char Dham pilgrimage (covering Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath) more convenient and there has been substantial success on that front. The same Kedarnath valley that was devastated in 2013 by cloudbursts and ravaging floods, today witnesses 300 helicopter sorties daily, taking two hours to transport pilgrims to and fro from the shrine, all blessings and tickets for salvation received. This evolution of comfort has been in tandem with the degradation of the local environment. The Chardham Mahamarg Vikas Pariyojana or the Char Dham Highway Development Project is a 900-km-long two-lane highway, that will improve connectivity to these shrines on completion. The stated objectives of the project are to mitigate risk, reduce travel time and increase comfort for pilgrims. One of the BJP's major pre-poll promises in Uttarakhand, the Char Dham Highway Development Project has been steamrolled through bureaucratic corridors. A pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and one of the major pre-poll promises of the BJP in the state, it has been steamrolled through bureaucratic corridors and is being treated as top priority. However, it is interesting to note what has ensued in the process of this acceleration. The 900 km project has been broken down into 53 segments, all less than 100 km in length. This has allowed it to silently slip between the rules requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Ã¢ÂÂ mandatory for road projects over 100 km in length. In the stretch along Sukkhi village, a bypass was proposed through the opposite mountain, making the current road that passes through the village redundant. This new proposed path is currently covered by a dense virgin forest that will have to be axed to make way for the highway. Villagers do not want the forest to be harmed, citing environmental reasons, and are hoping that the highway project just expands the existing road. Documents related to the road widening project, procured through an RTI by activists, and responses from the DFO office in Uttarkashi, mention the clearing of 3,595 trees for the project in the Dharasu-Gangotri stretch. Thereafter, in the Ã¢ÂÂBirendra Singh Matura vs MoEFCC, MoRTH, NHIDCL, BRO and the State of UttarakhandÃ¢ÂÂ case, petitioners contested this number and submitted proof that tree markings in just the 15 km Bhaironghati to Jhala stretch crossed over 6,000 (within the the Bhagirathi Eco Sensitive Zone), not including the unmarked trees and shrubs falling within this same area that were slated to be cut.

Surveys done over time, including those by the Geological Survey of India, indicate that these slopes are extremely fragile and fall under seismic zones IV and V. New trees and shrubs had been planted here for the purpose of slope stabilisation by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), as part of an existing undertaking for this area. But the new road project involves the cutting of some of these newly planted trees and shrubs, potentially further destabilising these slopes, creating a rather adverse situation for what aims to be an all-weather road. Work within the Bhagirathi ESZ has been currently put on hold, until a new Zonal Master Plan (ZMP) is created and approved. In the ongoing case in the National Green Tribunal between the Ã¢ÂÂCitizens for Green DehradunÃ¢ÂÂ and the authorities involved in the project, the court has pointed out that adequate measures have not been taken and indiscriminate dumping of muck continues on riverbanks and mountain slopes. However, there has still not been any action on this illegal activity that threatens more than just road safety. Mallika Bhanot, an environmental activist from the state, shares that landslides have also substantially increased in the under construction areas because of unmindful cutting of the mountain at odd angles, improper treatment and excessive felling of trees. Recent pictures sent by her show that muck dumping continues on the slopes of the mountains. It is in one such spot, Naalupani, that a bus fell into the gorge on 19 July.

This unmindful dumping of muck raises the river bed height, muddies the water and increases the frequency of cloudbursts, making it dangerous in case of flooding. Having witnessed the role played by heavy sediments in the flash floods of 2013 that resulted in huge destruction across the state, one would expect the authorities to be extra careful. Midway through the 2018 monsoon, there have already been about a dozen cloudburst events across the state of Uttarakhand, according to a report compiled by South Asia Network on Dams Rivers and People (SANDRP). This includes a massive cloudburst in Yamunotri, at a time when the state has received 13 percent less rainfall than normal. Is it possible to navigate through this increase in unstable climatic events on an Ã¢ÂÂall-weather roadÃ¢ÂÂ without addressing the reasons that are creating these situations and will continue to in the future?

It is a shame that there seems to be no indication of understanding from the state on the aspect of ecology, where Ã¢ÂÂdevelopmentÃ¢ÂÂ will have inevitably have cascading effects. A clear example of this is the tourism driven construction boom in Uttarakhand that has severely stressed out local resources. The case of Shimla in Himachal Pradesh is a clear example of where things are heading if they continue to be unregulated. Even new tourism plans being developed by the state do not offer any hope. Figures released by the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board are available through a document on the MoEFCC website, which cites a study on the Ã¢ÂÂcarrying capacityÃ¢ÂÂ of one of the Char Dham locations Ã¢ÂÂ Gangotri. Instead of discussing carrying capacity through a combined understanding of ecology and infrastructure, the interim report merely uses Ã¢ÂÂnumber of bedsÃ¢ÂÂ available as a yardstick for arriving at final numbers. The Draft Tourism Policy 2017 by Uttarakhand Tourism predicts that numbers of visitors to the state will grow to about 50 million or five crores by 2025. Of this, over two crore tourists are expected to be visiting for religious purposes.

These parts of the state are extremely prone to landslides and climate events. When I visited in 2017, leftovers from past incidents of landslides had still not been cleared. Treatment for landslides of some of these spots was still overdue, making the situation fragile and exposing both locals and pilgrims to risk. Anthropogenic activities across the world have resulted in an increase in global temperatures. The world today recognises climate change as one of the biggest threats to modern day society and human survival. These factors are affecting our glaciers, with changes clearly visible in glaciers in all our river basins. One study suggests that the Gangotri Ggacier shrank by 4.4 ÃÂ± 2.7 km2 (0.11 ÃÂ± 0.07 km2 aÃ¢ÂÂ1) between 1968 and 2006, attributing it to climate change effects. All other glaciers in the region display similar trends of retreat. Our best defense in the face of such climate change effects is to preserve our old forests, allocate newer areas for forest growth and introduce regulation on consumption and construction.

Thousands of protesting farmers clashed with police and paramilitary forces Tuesday after they were stopped from entering Delhi to press for their demands including remunerative crop prices and loan waivers. FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ leaders who met Union home minister Rajnath Singh for discussions said the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs assurances were not satisfactory and they will continue their agitation.
Farmers are Ã¢ÂÂnot satisfiedÃ¢ÂÂ with the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs assurance to look into their demands, said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Naresh Tikait, who is spearheading the protests.
Ã¢ÂÂWe will discuss this and then decide on future course of action. I canÃ¢ÂÂt decide anything alone, our committee will take the decision,Ã¢ÂÂ he added, reported PTI.
Union home minister Rajnath Singh held discussions with Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh and some farmersÃ¢ÂÂ leaders and Union minister of state for agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat then met the protesters at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.
Shekhawat told the farmers that the government will move court over the National Green TribunalÃ¢ÂÂs order to ban tractor and vehicles which are more than 10 years old, as had been sought by the protestors. On the problem of farm labour, he said the government would look at bringing changes to the minimum wage rules for rural areas to solve this problem, and has formed a committee of six chief ministers for this purpose, reported PTI.

That is why the farmers are unsatisfied. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt clear its stand even on the other main issue of loan waiver. They said they will discuss it in detail,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
The farmers, who planned to march to Kisan Ghat in Delhi to press for their 15-point charter of demands, broke through barricades when police stopped them by using water cannons and tear gas and deflating the tyres of tractors.
According to a Delhi police statement, Ã¢ÂÂa section of the crowd suddenly turned violent and tried to break the barricades forcefully through tractor-trolleysÃ¢ÂÂ while Ã¢ÂÂsome protestors also resorted to stone pelting and wielded lathis causing injuries to police personnel deployed on dutyÃ¢ÂÂ. It said Ã¢ÂÂonly the minimum required force was used to contain these aggressive and violent protestestorsÃ¢ÂÂ.
Seven policemen, including an assistant commissioner of police, were injured, it said.
The police crackdown was denounced by opposition parties.
Ã¢ÂÂOn International Day of Non-Violence, the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs two-year Gandhi Jayanti celebrations began with the brutal beating of farmers peacefully coming to Delhi.

Ahmedabad: At Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay RupaniÃ¢ÂÂs public gathering in Gir Somnath districtÃ¢ÂÂs Pransli village on Sunday, a farmer allegedly attempted suicide by drinking pesticide. Identified as Mashribhai Dodiya, the man was reportedly upset over the failure of removal of a panchayat land encroachment at the entrance of his farm by local authorities, which is situated in Kodinar talukaÃ¢ÂÂs Dolasa village.
Rahul Tripathi, Gir Somnath Superintendent of Police told news agency PTI that someone had illegally captured a panchayat plot situated outside the agricultural land belonging to the farmer which made it hard for him to enter his own land. Local authorities, despite orders by the collector, failed to act upon it.
Mashribhai consumed pesticide just as when the minister started addressing the gathering. He was then held and rushed to a government hospital by the police deputed at the venue. Doctors at the Veraval hospital reported his condition to be stable.
The farmer alleged that the encroachment of the panchayat land was a land mafiaÃ¢ÂÂs design. He claimed that some land mafia closed the road leading to his farm by encroaching upon a piece of land.
He had reportedly also approached the chief minister, who had then ordered that the encroachment be removed, but nothing had happened thus far. He further told reporters at the hospital that he had made repeated appeals to the taluka development officer (TDO) as well as the village Panchayat officials, only to no avail.

NEW DELHI: Indian navy divers on Sunday launched an operation to find 15 men trapped for more than two weeks in a flooded ""rat-hole"" coal mine in remote northeast India, police said.
The workers have been cut off since December 13 when water from a nearby river poured into the 106-metre (348 feet) deep illegal mine in Meghalaya state. There has been no sign of life, with the delayed rescue effort drawing public outrage, but the menÃÂ´s families are clinging to hopes that they may have found an air pocket.
""Fourteen navy divers arrived yesterday (Saturday) and surveyed the mine. They are trying to go inside now,"" police superintendent Sylvester Nongtnger told AFP.
""Rat hole"" mining involves digging into the side of hills and then burrowing tunnels up to five feet (1.5 metres) high to reach a coal seam.
A federal environment court banned wildcat mining in the mineral-rich state in 2014 after local communities complained it was polluting water sources and putting the lives of miners at risk.
With mine owners and the state government challenging the ban at IndiaÃÂ´s Supreme Court, the practice remains rampant.
Most of the miners are poor migrant labourers from neighbouring states.
In 2012, 15 miners were killed after they were trapped in another flooded rat-hole mine in Meghalaya. Their bodies were never recovered.
The latest incident has sparked a public outcry over the practice as well as poor rescue efforts.
The rescue had been hampered by a lack of power pumps and other equipment.
Last week the National Disaster Response Force requested the government send 10 heavy duty pumps to suck out water before divers could go in. The state-owned Coal India has sent some equipment and dozens of extra rescue workers arrived Friday.

Mumbai, November 21
Nearly 20,000 farmers from different parts of Maharashtra began their march to downtown Mumbai to protest, what they say, are unfulfilled promises by the Maharashtra government.
The Lok Sangharsh Morcha (LSM), an umbrella body of several farmer bodies which is organising the march, is demanding that the government grant access to local village bodies and tribal councils access to land and water resources.
Other demands of the farmers include implementation of the Swaminathan CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations, apart from extending healthcare benefits under the National Rural Health Mission in rural Maharashtra.
Ã¢ÂÂChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had promised that farm loans would be waived and rights of tribals on their land would be honoured. But these have not been fulfilled. Farmers are not getting fresh crop loans from banks and even the minimum support price announced by the government is not being provided to farmers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pratibha Shinde, LSM general secretary. The farmers had congregated in Nashik from different parts of Maharashtra earlier this week and arrived in Thane on Tuesday night. They began marching to Mumbai on Wednesday. According to the LSM, they will camp out at Somaiya College grounds at Sion in Central Mumbai before marching towards Azad Maidan in South Mumbai on Thursday.
Among those participating in the march include Swaraj Abhiyan chief Yogendra Yadav and noted conservationist Dr Rajendra Singh. According to police officials, the marchers wonÃ¢ÂÂt be allowed to proceed beyond Azad Maidan as winter session of the Maharashtra Assembly is in progress.
FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ representatives say most of the marchers are from the worst-affected areas of Marathwada, which is reeling under drought. According to state government officials, 17 districts in Marathwada and Vidarbha are facing drought this year.
Last March, farmers under the banner of All India Kisan Sabha had also marched to Mumbai and were given a written assurance by the CM about time-bound action.","Promises Ã¢ÂÂnot keptÃ¢ÂÂ, Maha farmers protest"

New Delhi: The government on Wednesday announced 6 per cent hike in support price of wheat at Rs 1,840 per quintal, a move that will give farmers an additional income of Rs 62,635 crore and help contain their simmering discontent over high input cost and low sales realisation.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved higher minimum support price (MSP) for winter-sown or Rabi crops.
The decision will help farmers earn an additional income of Rs 62,635 crore, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters in Delhi after the meeting.
The decision comes within months of announcing higher price for Kharif crops, when the government fulfilled its promise of giving farmers 50 per cent more price than their cost of production.
The cabinet has approved a Rs 105 per quintal hike in wheat MSP to Rs 1,840 for 2018-19 season, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said.
The MSP of wheat was Rs 1,735 per quintal in the 2017-18 crop year.
Radha Mohan Singh said the MSP for all Rabi crops is higher than the cost of production ranging from 50-112 per cent.
As per the CCEA decision, the MSP of barley has been increased by Rs 30 per quintal to Rs 1,440 per quintal, while that of gram (Chana) by Rs 220 per quintal to Rs 4,620 per quintal.
Masur's MSP has been raised by Rs 225 to Rs 4,275 per quintal, while the support price of rapeseed/mustard has been hiked by Rs 200 to Rs 4,200 per quintal. Safflower MSP has been increased by Rs 845 per quintal to Rs 4,945.
The support price has been increased based on the recommendations of farm advisory body CACP (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) and is in line with the government's announcement to provide farmers a 50 per cent profit over the cost of production.","After farmers march to Delhi, Govt hikes wheat MSP by Rs 105 per quintal"
210,1432,positive,"Bengaluru, Sep 10 (IANS/Mongabay) Heavy, incessant rainfall is a fact of life for the people of Kodagu (the erstwhile Coorg district) in Karnataka.

""For the old-timers here in Coorg, the last few months of rain was nothing new. None of us were really expecting such incredible damage to happen though,"" said Pavita Subbaiah, a resident of Madikeri. Subbaiah and her husband had shifted back to Kodagu five years ago, after he had retired from his job at Bengaluru. She added, ""Everyone thinks the reason for all this damage and loss of life is the buildings that have come up everywhere and the constant use of earthmovers and drillers. A fragile region like ours just cannot take that much pressure.""

The district of Kodagu is indeed used to heavy rains, especially when the Southwest monsoons traverses it during its journey across the Indian subcontinent. Thus, when heavy rains battered the region in June this year and continued over the next few months, there was an apprehension about loss of good coffee crop (Karnataka grows more than 50 percent of India's coffee) but no one was thinking of extensive damage, lesser still about entire villages being consumed by landslides. It was the mid-August rains that began on Independence Day, August 15, and continued unabated till August 17, that broke the levee, quite literally.

Over the course of three days, August 15, 16 and 17, Kodagu received 768 mm of rainfall. This is almost half of the entire rainfall received in August, which was 1,675 mm. The rainfall recorded in August 2018 broke all records in living memory -- it was back in 1931 that Kodagu had last received such heavy rainfall. Even then, August 1931 had recorded 1,559 mm of rainfall. The fact that this time most of the rain fell over a period of 72 hours made things worse.

The higher altitude towns and villages in the region just couldn't handle the rains. A third of all the panchayats in Kodagu were critically affected. At least 14 people were reported dead, more than 5,000 people were in rescue camps in the first few days after the rains, crop damages alone was estimated to be more than Rs 3 billion (Rs 300 crore).

A few villages in the worst-affected municipalities, Kushalnagar and Madikeri, have been completely submerged by landslides with no traces left of homes or farmland.

Kodagu is a region most famous for its coffee beans, martial prowess and, of course, for being the birthplace of the Cauvery -- the river that is the lifeline for millions of farmers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The district varies in altitude from 390 metres above mean sea level (MSL) up to 1,750 metres above MSL. Over the last decade or so, Kodagu has also seen a great inflow of tourists, with city slickers from Bengaluru and other urban centres driving down for weekend holidays. The number of home stays in Kodagu has mushroomed to keep up with the tourists and, as of now, every other coffee estate in the region doubles up as a home stay.

A senior forest official in Karnataka who declined to be named said that excessive tourism is detrimental to the but also argued that other underlying factors are not even discussed.

""In line with the global trend of deforestation and forest degradation, much forest area (mostly government lands) came under coffee cultivation in the last three decades in Kodagu,"" he said. ""The governance was under tremendous pressure to facilitate development. There was no stopping this trend as the priority of governance was not in regulating and containing encroachments or unbridled development but to regularise and promote it.""

The official added, ""Since coffee cultivation is under shade of trees, deforestation was less visible to satellite imagery and less visually arresting. The landslides have primarily happened in the revenue villages of Mukkodlu, Galibeedu, Kalur, Monnangeri and Madapur. These are some of the areas that have been recently deforested. Deforestation in Kodagu is cryptic and happens below the radar. The landscape remains green and the canopy cover shows little change, but the land below changes significantly.""

According to the Coffee Board of India, Kodagu accounts for 107,089 hectares of the 2,44,785 hectares of coffee plantations in Karnataka, the state which accounts for over 53 percent of India's coffee production. Thus, if this deforestation is a reality, it is happening at an overwhelming scale.

All the talk and focus in Kodagu right now is about getting the district back on its feet. The region is still reeling from the disaster with 25 relief camps acting as temporary homes to about 3,000 victims. At least five people are missing and the search is still on for them. The state electricity board is trying to get their services up and running but heavy landslides and damage to arterial roads is proving to be a major impediment.

As Kodagu recovers, there is talk about reviving the recommendations made by committees such as the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (popularly known as the Gadgil committee report). The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) not to reduce the eco-sensitive area (ESA) of Western Ghats further from the proposed 56,825 sq kms and to notify the same within six months.

These are signs of acknowledging that anthropogenic activities should be reduced in regions such as Kodagu. Whether this will translate effectively on the ground is still questionable.

When the globe warms by 3-4 degrees Celsius Ã¢ÂÂ a possibility during this century under a Ã¢ÂÂbusiness as usualÃ¢ÂÂ scenario Ã¢ÂÂ about 40% of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs land surface is predicted to experience drought. The tropics are all set to experience high temperatures as the new normal.

With drought and heat posing individual threats, there is also the looming threat of frequent Ã¢ÂÂdouble whammiesÃ¢ÂÂ of drought and heat: concurrent drought and heatwaves, across India and the globe.

A recent study found that the area under concurrent drought and heatwaves in India expanded significantly in the 1981-2000 period as compared to the 1951-1980 period. Moreover, the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and drought has increased as well.

Ã¢ÂÂWe divided 60 years of data into two halves taking 1951-1980 as the base period,Ã¢ÂÂ said Shailza Sharma, one of the authors of the study. Ã¢ÂÂAt each grid, we computed the differences in number of concurrent droughts and heatwaves for the period 1981 to 2010 with respect to the base period. These results indicate that simultaneous occurrence of droughts and heatwaves have increased.Ã¢ÂÂ

The study found that concurrence of extreme drought and longer, more severe heatwaves is increasing in Gujarat, Central India and Peninsular India.

The response of vegetation to a combination of drought and stress is complex, ranging from short-lived local mortality events to regional-scale death of forests. A variety of forest types have shown mortality in the face of concurrent heat and drought: dry savannas which are adapted to seasonal rainfall, coniferous forests with a Mediterranean climate to tropical rainforests.

How forests respond

Trees typically handle high temperatures for short durations when there is sufficient water; they use water to cool leaves by evapotranspiration and cool the stems as water passes through. Drought conditions when temperatures are already high impede the treesÃ¢ÂÂ cooling mechanisms and can cause cell damage and oxidative stress. Dry conditions increase transpiration; with an already dry soil, the trees must deal with both dry atmosphere and dry soil. They need to remain hydrated to avoid a Ã¢ÂÂwhole-system transport failureÃ¢ÂÂ which would ultimately lead to death of the tree.

At the local forest scale, mortality due to drought is influenced by life history and tolerances of individual species to drought. Because trees are long-lived, they can reallocate resources and change their hydraulic architecture in response to drought. This particular adaptation makes it difficult to interpret or predict the response of trees to drought; a severe drought can manifest as tree mortality after a gap of many years.

However, drought-induced mortality is not restricted to dry forests where water is scarce. After a severe El Nino event in 1997-Ã¢ÂÂ98, more than a quarter of the trees in the rainforests of Borneo died out. Mortality in tropical wet forests seems to be triggered by short but extreme seasonal drought. The prevalence of climate-induced tree mortality in wet forests implies that the global rise in temperature may be pushing species over the edge.

Fires would probably negatively affect forests that have not historically evolved with fire, said Ankila Hiremath from the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, or ATREE. Such forests would have species that are not adapted to withstand heat-caused damage, she said.

In temperate forests, drought induces death of deciduous species rather than the evergreen conifers. A well-documented, large-scale heat and drought event in the summer of 2003 in Europe caused a 30% decrease in gross primary production, making the region a net source of carbon dioxide rather than a sink as it had been in previous years. Some forests showed growth reductions of 50%. A study of 18 tree species during this heat and drought event reported that most species had decreased chlorophyll and increased tocopherol and xanthophyll pigments, both of which would increase protection of the leaf photosynthesis machinery against excessive light energy.

Ã¢ÂÂIt is possible that there could be a shift in forest type,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hiremath. Ã¢ÂÂSevere multi-year drought could potentially lead to mortality of species that are not tolerant of such conditions. In such situations fire could exacerbate the effects by causing additional tree mortality. This could open up the forest, give way to more savanna like conditions. But then it also depends on what you mean by prolonged drought.Ã¢ÂÂ

Jagdish Krishnaswamy, an ecologist studying forest hydrology at ATREE, said, Ã¢ÂÂApart from concurrent drought and heat, a severe drought followed by a heatwave can have a more severe effect.Ã¢ÂÂ

A study examining remote sensing vegetation data from 47 protected areas, all biodiversity hotspots 1,000 metres above mean sea level in five continental regions of Africa, Central America, South America, South Asia and Southeast Asia found Ã¢ÂÂbrowningÃ¢ÂÂ or drying up of forests across all the tropical mountain regions. Such browning has been reported for large areas of the northern hemisphere and tropical regions. The main reason behind the forest browning is combined moisture stress: the joint effects of rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation.

Prone to fires

Ã¢ÂÂTypically, droughts are associated with a greater occurrence of fire,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hiremath. Ã¢ÂÂFires need fuel and an ignition source. Hot and dry conditions can lead to more dry biomass being available to burn, so one would expect a higher probability of fire occurrence.Ã¢ÂÂ

An analysis of fires in India between 2004 and 2011 released by the Forest Survey of India shows that the periods with maximum fires varied among different areas in India: the North East had maximum fires between the first week of March and third week of April, South India between the first week of February and first week of April and north and Central India between the last week of February and third week of June. Fires coincided with the dry season in all these areas. Also, fires during this period correlated with scanty premonsoon rainfall.

The most fires were in 2009-Ã¢ÂÂ10 in undivided Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Tripura and Mizoram. The high number of fires coincided with a monsoon failure and resultant drought due to the cyclone Aila.

The droughts in 2004, 2004, 2009, 2012 and 2016 correspond with the total number of fires in these years, especially in peninsular India. In the northern states, the correlation between fires and drought is not so evident, probably because of the practice of crop residue burning, which is also picked up by satellites.

Ã¢ÂÂAfter a period of drought, the fuel load will first increase,Ã¢ÂÂ said Jagmohan Sharma, a researcher and the additional principal chief conservator of forests with KarnatakaÃ¢ÂÂs forest department. Ã¢ÂÂIf the monsoon fails in successive years, productivity will go down and lesser material will be available for burning. If fires occur continuously and productivity keeps going down, it will result in desertification.Ã¢ÂÂ

The maximum number of fires occurred in tropical semi-evergreen forests, followed by tropical moist deciduous, tropical dry deciduous, subtropical broadleaved hill forests and subtropical pine forests. The highest fire radiant power, or FRP, which denotes the quantity of fuel burnt during fires, shows that the most intense fires occur in tropical moist deciduous forests, implying the forest type is very vulnerable. Tropical dry deciduous forests had a higher number of fires, but at a lower FRP, showing that there was lesser fuel available in dry forests.

Ã¢ÂÂMany dry forests are infested with the invasive weed Lantana camara, which adds to the threat of fire in interesting ways,Ã¢ÂÂ said Jagmohan Sharma. Ã¢ÂÂLantana increases the fuel load because the species is opportunistic, out-competes native species and proliferates almost without assistance from any other agent. The plant can sometimes climb trees, which is an acquired behaviour. It causes fire that is higher than what would be if Lantana wasnÃ¢ÂÂt there.Ã¢ÂÂ

Chances of future fires

A whopping 55% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forests are prone to annual fires, predominantly the deciduous type in the peninsula and the pine forests of the Western Himalayas, reports a 2013 study.

The Forest Survey of India mapped the country into 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch grids, calculated the vulnerability to fire and found that about 15% of the total area is vulnerable to forest fire. Of the 348 vulnerable districts, the maximum number are in central India, especially Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.

On correlating areas vulnerable to fires with other socioeconomic parameters such as poverty, the analysis found that over half the districts vulnerable to fires have large populations (31%-47%) living below poverty line, increasing their dependence on forests for livelihood. People venturing into forests to collect various items in turn makes the forest areas more vulnerable to fire.

Jagmohan Sharma agreed. Ã¢ÂÂMost fires are human induced in our country,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWhen there is an extended period of drought, more humans and domestic cattle move into the forest for collecting various materials because the drought adds an economic pressure. If it is already dry, it takes lesser ignition force for the fire to start. The reasons behind humans setting fire to forests is varied. For example, some villagers may set fire to forests hoping to stimulate growth of grass for their cattle.Ã¢ÂÂ

The 2017 Indian State of Forest Report recognises fire as a tool in scientific forest management. Ã¢ÂÂPeople living around forests light intentional fires to promote grass growth, clear areas for shifting cultivation and clear the forest floor for collection of non-timber forest produce,Ã¢ÂÂ the report states. Ã¢ÂÂFires are also used to flush out wildlife for hunting, and encroach forest land.Ã¢ÂÂ Unintentional fires are also common; cigarette or beedi butts can cause havoc if not noticed early.

Impact of climate change

Ã¢ÂÂVulnerabilityÃ¢ÂÂ is a term used to describe the susceptibility of a forest to the adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. An idea of the vulnerability of different forest types can inform management in the face of climate change Ã¢ÂÂ a good place to start when analysing the effect of a drastic climatic event like concurrent drought and heat. A 2017 study based on the Indian State of Forest Report 2013 categorised forests into different vulnerability classes Ã¢ÂÂ low, medium, high and very high Ã¢ÂÂ based on four indicators, including biological richness and level of disturbance. At the national level, 40% of the forest grids showed high or very high vulnerability. These grids were concentrated in the dry deciduous forests, especially in peninsular and central India. Plantation forests showed more vulnerability than natural forests.

The study also went a step further and used models to predict future climate and vegetation type in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forest areas in the short term (2030s) and the long term (2080s). With this information, they were able to predict a change in vegetation type in almost half (46%) of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs forest grid cells by 2030; the number goes up to 49%-54% in the long term. Most of the grids prone to vegetation change are located in west and central India and in the interior peninsula Ã¢ÂÂ tropical dry deciduous forests and plantations.

Ã¢ÂÂIn these grids, it was seen that the present vegetation cannot sustain itself under future climate,Ã¢ÂÂ said Jagmohan Sharma, one of the studyÃ¢ÂÂs authors. Ã¢ÂÂBut, will forests get a chance to make a transition into another vegetation type? Ideally, there should not be any non-climatic factors affecting the transition. Since this is never the case, typically, the existing forest goes, a new forest tries to establish itself, it is unable to do so, and there is degradation. We also donÃ¢ÂÂt know at what speed climate changes would occur. How would a forest respond? We donÃ¢ÂÂt know.Ã¢ÂÂ

Heavy, incessant rainfall is a fact of life for the people of Kodagu (the erstwhile Coorg district) in Karnataka. Ã¢ÂÂFor the old-timers here in Coorg, the last few months of rain was nothing new. None of us was really expecting such incredible damage to happen though,Ã¢ÂÂ said Pavita Subbaiah, a resident of Madikeri. Subbaiah and her husband had shifted back to Kodagu five years ago, after he had retired from his job at Bengaluru. She added, Ã¢ÂÂEveryone thinks the reason for all this damage and loss of life is the buildings that have come up everywhere and the constant use of earthmovers and drillers. A fragile region like ours just cannot take that much pressure.Ã¢ÂÂ

Extensive damage

The district of Kodagu is indeed used to heavy rains, especially when the southwest monsoon traverses it during its journey across the Indian subcontinent. Thus, when heavy rains battered the region in June this year and continued over the next few months, there was an apprehension about loss of good coffee crop (Karnataka grows more than 50 per cent of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs coffee) but no one was thinking of extensive damage, lesser still about entire villages being consumed by landslides. It was the mid-August rains that began on Independence Day, August 15, and continued unabated till August 17, that broke the levee, quite literally.

Over the course of three days, August 15, 16 and 17, Kodagu received 768 mm of rainfall. This is almost half of the entire rainfall received in August, which was 1,675 mm. The rainfall recorded in August 2018 broke all records in living memory Ã¢ÂÂ it was back in 1931 that Kodagu had last received such heavy rainfall. Even then, August 1931 had recorded 1,559 mm of rainfall. The fact that this time most of the rain fell over a period of 72 hours made things worse.

The higher altitude towns and villages in the region just could not handle the rains. A third of all the panchayats in Kodagu were critically affected. At least 14 people were reported dead, more than 5,000 people were in rescue camps in the first few days after the rains, crop damages alone were estimated to be more than Rs 3 billion (Rs 300 crore). A few villages in the worst-affected municipalities, Kushalnagar and Madikeri, have been completely submerged by landslides with no traces left of homes or farmland.

Deforestation

Kodagu is a region most famous for its coffee beans, martial prowess and, of course, for being the birthplace of the Cauvery Ã¢ÂÂ the river that is the lifeline for millions of farmers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The district varies in altitude from 390 metres above mean sea level (MSL) up to 1,750 metres above MSL. Over the last decade or so, Kodagu has also seen a great inflow of tourists, with city slickers from Bengaluru and other urban centres driving down for weekend holidays. The number of home stays in Kodagu has mushroomed to keep up with the tourists and, as of now, every other coffee estate in the region doubles up as a home stay.

A senior forest official in Karnataka who declined to be named said that excessive tourism is detrimental to the environment but also argued that other underlying factors are not even discussed. Ã¢ÂÂIn line with the global trend of deforestation and forest degradation, much forest area (mostly government lands) came under coffee cultivation in the last three decades in Kodagu,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThe governance was under tremendous pressure to facilitate development. There was no stopping this trend as the priority of governance was not in regulating and containing encroachments or unbridled development but to regularise and promote it.Ã¢ÂÂ The official added, Ã¢ÂÂSince coffee cultivation is under shade of trees, deforestation was less visible to satellite imagery and less visually arresting. The landslides have primarily happened in the revenue villages of Mukkodlu, Galibeedu, Kalur, Monnangeri and Madapur. These are some of the areas that have been recently deforested. Deforestation in Kodagu is cryptic and happens below the radar. The landscape remains green and the canopy cover shows little change, but the land below changes significantly.Ã¢ÂÂ

Gadgil panel guidelines

According to the Coffee Board of India, Kodagu accounts for 1,07,089 hectares of the 2,44,785 hectares of coffee plantations in Karnataka, the state which accounts for over 53 per cent of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs coffee production. Thus, if this deforestation is a reality, it is happening at an overwhelming scale. All the talk and focus in Kodagu right now is about getting the district back on its feet. The region is still reeling from the disaster with 25 relief camps acting as temporary homes to about 3,000 victims. At least five people are missing and the search is still on for them. The state electricity board is trying to get their services up and running but heavy landslides and damage to arterial roads is proving to be a major impediment.

As Kodagu recovers, there is talk about reviving the recommendations made by committees such as the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (popularly known as the Gadgil committee report). The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) not to reduce the eco-sensitive area (ESA) of Western Ghats further from the proposed 56,825 sq km and to notify the same within six months. These are signs of acknowledging that anthropogenic activities should be reduced in regions such as Kodagu. Whether this will translate effectively on the ground is still questionable.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian forest rangers have launched a hunt for a leopard that killed a monk meditating under a tree deep in a jungle.
The monk, Rahul Walke Bodhi, had been meditating in the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in the western state of Maharashtra for the last month, and was attacked while offering morning prayers on Tuesday, a forest official said.
Two other monks who were on their way to give him food said they witnessed the attack but Walke was dead by the time they reached him, according to a second forest official.
Ã¢ÂÂI would like to tell everyone not to go into the forest,Ã¢ÂÂ Gajendra Narwane, deputy director of the reserve, told the BBC Marathi-language service.
Forest rangers have set up two cages and a camera trap to try to capture the animal. It was not clear what they would do with it if they caught it.
The forest, some 825 km (510 miles) east of the city of Mumbai, is in a reserve for big cats where four other fatal attacks have occurred in the last few weeks, according to media.

New Delhi/Lucknow: Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Sanjay Sharma on Thursday gave a scathing reply to a group of former bureaucrats, who had, in a letter, slammed the Uttar Pradesh BJP regime and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the shocking mob violence in Bulandshahr on December 3. Saying that the former civil servants were worried about only two human deaths, Sharma said no one bothered about 21 dead cows.
Police officer Subodh Kumar Singh and a civilian were killed in the violence which erupted over alleged cow slaughter. In an open letter, the ex-bureaucrats questioned Modi's ""stony silence"" over the violence and said the incident showed the ""perverted"" fundamental principles of governance and constitutional ethics of Yogi Adityanath-led UP government under which, ""hooliganism and thuggery have been mainstreamed into governance"".
The letter was signed by 83 former civil servants, including ex-foreign secretaries Shyam Saran and Shivsankar Menon, and former Ambassador and DGP Julio Ribeiro.
It had called for the resignation of UP CM Yogi Adityanath and appealed to the Allahabad High Court to take suo motu cognisance of the violence and the ""cold-blooded murder"" of Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, and initiate a judicial probe.
""The Bulandshahr mob violence instigated and engineered with malicious intent, marks the most dangerous turn yet in the direction taken by the politics of hate in recent times.""

""It shows that in India's most populous state, fundamental principles of governance, of constitutional ethics and of humane social conduct stand perverted.

""This was a deliberate attempt to display majoritarian muscle and send a message to Muslim communities living in the region that they have to live in fear, accept their subordinate status and conform to the cultural diktats of the majority community,"" the letter read.
Facing flak over the handling of Bulandshahr violence case, Adityanath had on Wednesday hit out at his detractors, alleging the incident was a ""political conspiracy"".
""The state government has uncovered a big conspiracy. Those who wanted to spread anarchy and lawlessness through cow slaughter, their motive has been defeated.

With the Maharashtra government doling out pieces of the lush green Aarey forest to various utilities, the tribals living in it for generations are feeling increasingly insecure. Hepzi Anthony reports.

The Maharashtra government plans to rehabilitate all the tribals living within Mumbai's green zone of Aarey under its slum redevelopment projects within the colony.

Minister of state for housing and local Shiv Sena legislator from Aarey, Ravindra Waikar, informed this reporter that the state government is trying to rehabilitate tribals in one corner of Aarey so that the rest of the land could get freed up for developmental work.

""We have decided to change the Development Plan of the city to accommodate these people. These tribals are spread out over 185 places. If they all are housed in one place, that could be around 125 acres, then so much of land could open up for development,"" Waikar told Rediff.com.

The residents of Aarey, who mainly comprise Warli tribals and are Mumbai's oldest residents, are naturally on the edge over this decision. Though the development plan sounds generous on the face of it, it has led to fear and a sense of apprehension among the residents.

That these tribals occupy the largest stretch of open space available in the entire city as of now, makes all powerful lobbies, including the state government, eye this piece of land for their developmental works.

Photograph: Hitesh Harisinghani / Rediff.com IMAGE: Residential buildings on the nearby highway form a distant backdrop to the tribal hamlet inside Aarey.

That Aarey is officially declared as an eco-sensitive zone and hence a no- development area with no construction allowed in it, has not deterred them.

Waikar says the state government is already planning to amend the cityÃ¢ÂÂs Development Plan to ensure housing schemes are allowed on a stretch of 125 acres, although only for local residents.

""The Aarey residents are human beings and it is unfair to them that they should live in constant fear of the likes of wild animals like leopards around them. They should be resettled in proper houses,"" Waikar justifies the decision.

The state government is also planning to rehabilitate tribal residents from the neighbouring SanjayGandhiNational Park; housing for them is being planned within Aarey within the 100 acres to be allocated to a new, proposed zoo.

Currently, the deputy collector (encroachment) is carrying out a survey to find the exact number of people residing there, both legal and illegal.

As the government keeps doling out pieces of the lush green Aarey forest to various government departments, the tribals living there are feeling increasingly insecure about being displaced from their own lands and their way of life.

Right from the inception of Aarey Milk Colony in 1949, when 3162 acres of green forests of Goregaon were handed over by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the noble purpose of providing cheap milk to the city of Mumbai, the green patch today stands allotted piecemeal to various government and private agencies.

Initially, about 30 stables were constructed, with each unit bearing a capacity to hold over 500 animals along with an attached building for ancillary functions like chaff-cutting, hay godown and even residential accommodation for staff and cattle-owners to house animals.

Private cattle owners from various parts of Mumbai were also encouraged to shift their buffalo stables there on rent. Currently, about 16,120 buffaloes are being reared in the 30 units of Aarey, according to the chief executive officer of Aarey Diary Development Board, Nathulal Rathod.

The State Reserve Police Force came in 1977, taking away a chunk of about 200 acres of land.

Recently, in 2009, Force One, India's premier anti-terrorism strike force, was handed over about 98 acres of land in the wake of the 26/11 terror attacks on Mumbai.

And Mumbai Metro, the latest land allottee, has only added to the residentsÃ¢ÂÂ fears that they are being squeezed out of their environment.

Recently, residents of Prajapurpada were forcibly evicted and shifted to Slum Redevelopment Authority flats in Chakala, Andheri East, to make way for the Mumbai Metro carshed project. The residentsÃ¢ÂÂ objections were overruled, their protests ignored and their pleas to retain their traditional way of life, rejected.

""My parents had about 100 hens when we stayed in Aarey in 2017, that earned them a steady monthly income of about Rs 5000. After being forced into flats, they just couldn't raise the hens there. Also, no compensation was for their loss of one and a half acres of paddy field. Community bonding is also completely lost as relatives are now spread out far and wide,"" rues Sanjay Padvi, a bank manager who lost his family home and fields to Mumbai Metro.

In fact, many tribals allege that they are not allowed to even farm in their own farmlands, with the government itself not keen to support their demand.

Activists are sceptical of the government's intentions and accuse it of being hand in glove with the powerful builders lobby eyeing the prime piece of land.

The Aarey Conservation Group, a citizensÃ¢ÂÂ initiative which has been working to protect the forest from the harmful impact of development, is also opposed to the displacement of tribals.

""The government has been doling out land to various projects but they are not bothered about the people affected by these projects,"" complains Cassandra Nazareth, who works for Aarey tribal womenÃ¢ÂÂs welfare and is part of the ACG.

""These are the original residents of Mumbai, the sons of the soil here, and itÃ¢ÂÂs actually Mumbai's urban-dwellers who are the encroachers. These tribals have been living here for centuries but now they are being served with eviction notices, not allowed to carry out alterations in their own homes and even denied permissions to rebuild their houses. The government cannot force these people out,"" she says.

Stalin Dayanand, director (conservation) of non- government organisation Vanashakti, felt that rapid allocation of land from Aarey probably had to do with the fact that the forest is currently the largest land bank available in Mumbai, which the state is trying to usurp. Vanashakti is fighting many legal battles to save Aarey and has even approached the National Green Tribunal.

""The government is even trying to take over the buffer zone between Aarey and the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which is declared as an eco-sensitive zone and hence is a no-development area. With the 2019 elections round the corner, there is an undue haste on the part of the government to clear as many projects to private entities within this space.

Ã¢ÂÂThe tribal people are being short-changed by the government with the help of developers. The government cannot deny them their fields in the name of development. They cannot be put in 250 sq ft flats. Is the government going to take care of their livelihood or hand out Rs 15-20,000 per month to them?"" asks Dayanand.

This is also what the local people are uneasy about -- of being pushed into small, dingy flats, away from their farms and the wide spaces around them.

""We live with our hens and goats. Farming is our source of livelihood. We are the sons of the soil and do not wish to lose touch with our base. How can we continue with our livelihood from flats? The authorities even refuse to let us grow our crops. What will our young boys do?"" says Sita Umbersade, a resident of Navsachapada, one of the 27 tribal enclaves in Aarey colony.

""Local residents have already successfully got orders from the Bombay high court that indigenous people like them cannot be put under SRA. They are eligible to receive land for land and house for house (not a flat) under the Maharashtra Urban Transport Planning Act. Aarey has a Floor Space Index of 3, which means a house could be built three times. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like taking away their 3000 sq ft house and putting them in 269 sq ft flats,"" observes Amrita Bhattacharjee of ACG.

Prakash Bhoir of tribal welfare group Shramjeevi Sanghatana, points out that the community is keen to hold on to its traditional way of living amidst the lush green fields. Their livestock rearing also continues to provide a steady source of income for many families in the midst of a concrete jungle like Mumbai.

""We are dependent on our farms and fruit trees like mango and jackfruit. We grow leafy vegetables, cucumber, ladies finger, snake gourd etc during the monsoons. Lack of availability of water sources hampers our farming, as well as denial of farming rights by various authorities that now claim ownership over our land,"" says Bhoir.

Amidst all this, people like Asha Bhoye await their fate with fear, uncertainty and despair. Her neighbours recently received eviction notices from the Mumbai Metro project and she knows her turn will come soon.

""Who would want to leave Aarey and get into a flat?"" says Bhoye. She wants to continue rearing her hens and grow crops on her half-acre farm, but is unsure if she will be able to do that for long.

A protester, injured in the violence in Navi Mumbai, had succumbed to his injuries. A number of people from the community had earlier committed suicide in support of the quota demand.
Meanwhile, a PIL has been filed against the Morcha in Bombay High Court for resorting to violence during a protest. The petitioner, in the PIL, requested compensation for loss of public property.
Marathas, a politically influential community that constitutes around 30 per cent of the state's population, have been demanding a 16 per cent reservation. The community had earlier taken out silent marches across the state to highlight their demands, prominent among them being that of reservation.

Speaking to reporters at his residence Varsha on the occasion of Diwali Milan, the chief minister said that everyone was saddened by the death of Avni.
Mumbai: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday ordered a probe into the controversial killing of the tigress Avni.
Reacting to the allegations against the state government by Union Cabinet minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) colleague Maneka Gandhi, Mr Fadnavis said that apart from being a minister, Ms Gandhi is an animal rights activist. Ã¢ÂÂThough the minister has been critical of the state government, we should understand her feelings for animals,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Speaking to reporters at his residence Varsha on the occasion of Diwali Milan, the chief minister said that everyone was saddened by the death of Avni. Ã¢ÂÂThe forest department decided to kill the tigress as she had killed 13 to 14 people. Whatever had happened, some dou-bts have been raised. We will certainly inquire into it,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
Mr Fadnavis also said, Ã¢ÂÂAn inquiry will be conducted into whether the proper procedure was followed or not.Ã¢ÂÂ
He said the probe would find out if the tigress was first killed and later darted.
In a series of tweets on Sunday, Ms Gandhi denounced the government, stating, Ã¢ÂÂIt is nothing but a straight case of crime. Despite several requests from many stakeholders, Sh@-SMungantiwar, Minister for Forests, #Maharas-htra, gave orders for the killing.Ã¢ÂÂ
She also said, Ã¢ÂÂI am deeply saddened by the way tigress Avni has been brutally murdered in #Yavatmal, #Maha-rashtra. Every time he has used Hyderabad-based shooter Shafat Ali Khan and this time his son has also appeared at the scene illegally to murder the tigress. His son was not authorised to kill. This is patently illegal. Despite the forest officials being committed to tranquillise, capture and quarantine the tigress, the trigger-happy shooter has killed her on his own under orders of Sh@Smungantiwar.Ã¢ÂÂ
The chief minister further said, Ã¢ÂÂWe are working hard to preserve wildlife, especially to increase the numbers of the tiger population. A tiger becomes a man-eater when its habitat is violatedÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Hence, the sad decision was taken to eliminate her. At the same time, if she could have been captured and kept in a zoo, we could have rehabilitated her, but what I have been told is that she had attacked (the person trying to dart her).Ã¢ÂÂ
On the stinging statements made by Ms Gandhi, Mr Fadnavis said, Ã¢ÂÂManekaji is an animal activist from her heart.

KeralaÃ¢ÂÂs worst floods in close to a century left hundreds of people dead, displaced over a million, and caused unprecedented loss of property worth billion of rupees in less than a fortnight. Though excessive rains filled the dams, experts blamed poor water flow management from the reservoirs for the inundation of the coastal state and many parts of the southern India. It is not for the first time that this has happened.
A Comptroller and Auditor General report submitted in Tamil Nadu Assembly in 2016 squarely blamed the unwarranted release of 29,000 cusecs of water for 21 hours in December 2015, in violation of dam safety norms, for flooding in Chennai. The report said the floods could have been avoided had the Public Works Department followed the Central Water Commission guidelines on regulated water release from the three water tanks upstream of the city.
In hindsight, water experts are saying that the intensity of Kerala floods could have been reduced if the water from 35 big dams in Kerala was released much earlier. Kerala blamed neighbouring Tamil Nadu for the floods in the Supreme Court on Friday, saying the gates of Mullaperiyar dam were suddenly opened without any warning, a claim denied by Tamil Nadu government.
What has happened in Kerala poses a bigger question regarding flood management in India considering that around 15% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs land mass is prone to floods, with an average of 1,548 people losing their lives and around eight million hectares getting affected, causing loss of about Rs 5,628 crore every year. The 5,254 dams in India are an integral part of flood management, apart from storing water for irrigation and generating power.
5,254 dams, not all flood-ready The 5,254 dams in India are an integral part of flood management, apart from storing water for irrigation and generating power. A 2017 CAG report submitted in Parliament said that there is emergency action plan for only seven percent of these dams. For the 61 in Kerala, there is none. History of Mullaperiyar Dam
1895: A dam was built on the river Mullayar and its tributary, Periyar, in Kerala, to provide water to deficit regions of Tamil Nadu. 1979: The Kerala government claimed that the dam was in an earth-quake prone area and sought its rebuilding. 1980s: Tamil Nadu demanded height of the dam to be raised to about 150 feet from existing 136, which Kerala opposed. 2006: The Supreme Court directed that the water level to be raised to 142 feet but Kerala brought a law to negate it. The SC appointed a panel to examine safety and the new dam.

The 2017 CAG report submitted in Parliament presented an insight on what is wrong with IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs flood management plan. Of the 219 proposed new telemetry stations, used to forecast floods, only a quarter were set-up till August 2016. Of the 375 existing stations, almost 60% were non-functional after installation, the report said.
Ã¢ÂÂFlood forecasting data was used in the formulation of flood forecast only after comparing the telemetry data with manually observed data; and in the case of mismatch between the two sets of data, manual data was adopted,Ã¢ÂÂ the CAG report said, pulling up CWC for not depending on telemetry data even after investing in modernisation for nearly 20 years.
The report also said that there is an emergency action plan for only 7% of the dams in India. For the 61 in Kerala, there is none. In eight out of 17 flood-prone states, the integrated flood management plans for entire river/basin have not been taken up, the report said.
The auditor also said that frequent check of dams before and after monsoon happened in only two -- Bihar and Odisha -- of the 17 two states in recent years.
Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary in the ministry of earth sciences, admitted earlier this week that there was poor flood management system in India.
Ã¢ÂÂAs per my understanding, no big reservoir has a decision support system. So we donÃ¢ÂÂt know when to open gates and how to open themÃ¢ÂÂ¦There is a common perception that in India most of the flood management systems are not supported by science. I am very sure we donÃ¢ÂÂt have a decision support system and we need it,Ã¢ÂÂ he had said.
AK Gosain, professor emeritus at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, agreed with him and said dam management in India works on the principle that at end of the monsoon the reservoirs should be full. Ã¢ÂÂThe tendency is not to release water till the last go and this is what has happened in Kerala,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People said the reason for this tendency was that most of the big dams in India are run by the power generation companies, who are unwilling to reduce water level beyond a limit as it can impact power generation. In Kerala, the water level in the big dams is monitored by Kerala State Electricity Board.
Experts say the flooding in downstream areas can be better managed if the India Meteorological DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs 72-hour forecast is used to create simulation models for water release. Gujarat and Odisha governments use the IMDÃ¢ÂÂs forecast to release water slowing from the dams on Tapi and Mahanadi rivers respectively, helping the two states manage floods. Despite Gujarat receiving substantial rainfall in 2017, Surat city on the Tapi river was not flooded

222,1523,positive,"Demanding a CBI inquiry into the land grabbings of Chandrababu Naidu government, YSR Congress has said that the Chief Minister has led his party leaders by example in encroaching prime lands.

Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, party spokesperson Vasireddy Padma said, large extent of lands was being encroached by TDP leaders and workers and the Chief Ministers residence itself is on an encroached land on the Krishna River front which paved way for the land scams.

The records are being tampered with and all disputed lands and prime lands have been encroached by TDP leaders and the name of TDP MLA Bonda Uma and Cabinet Minister Devineni Uma has come up prominently. In Vijayawada the encroachments have been rampant ever since the new state was formed. Lands of educational institutions and those given for public utilities were being taken away by people in power by tampering with the records, she said.

Students have been agitating against the encroachment of college lands in Vijayawada which shows the gravity of the situation.

In the name of capital formation, fertile land of farmers was taken away while the coterie and TDP leaders could get land at throwaway prices. Decisions were taken in advance and were formalised through cabinet meetings, which were always allotting lands to the favoured few.

One of the cabinet ministers had accused of a Rs 1500 crore land scam in Vizag involving another minister and the matter was hushed up which shows the interests of the state government, which has been encouraging encroachments and everything happens with the full knowledge of the Chief Minster and money changes in large sums, she said.

223,1526,positive,"New Delhi: The Centre has decided to call a meeting of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu chief ministers soon to discuss the proposed Mekedatu dam on the Cauvery river, an issue which led to stalling of Parliament proceedings last week.
The proposed dam project in Mekedatu in Karnataka, is being opposed by Tamil Nadu which argues that it will affect its farmers.
The issue was discussed in detail by Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy in a meeting with Union Water Resources and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday here.
""In the meeting, Gadkari said he was convinced that the Mekedatu project will benefit Tamil Nadu. The minister also assured that he will direct his officials to fix a meeting of chief ministers of the two states at the earliest,"" an official spokesperson of the Karnataka government told reporters.
The Mahadayi water dispute between Karnataka and Goa was also discussed in the meeting, but the Union minister said the matter is in court, he said.
Gadkari has said he will call the meeting of chief ministers of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to discuss the implementation of the project, according to an official statement issued by the Karnataka government.
The Karnataka chief minister during the meeting brought to Gadkari's notice that Tamil Nadu has raised objection against the project though it is beneficial to both states, especially for Tamil Nadu, the statement added.
He also requested Gadkari to resolve the issue by calling the meetings of the chief ministers. ""Gadkari obliged to call a meeting accordingly,"" it said.
On the Mahadayi issue, the Goa government has approached the Supreme Court and Kumaraswamy said this has obstructed his state from using its share of water. Hence, the chief minister appealed to Gadkari to discuss the issue with Goa and resolve it, the statement said.
Kumaraswamy told PTI that ""we have asked the Centre to call for a meeting with the Tamil Nadu government so that the (Mekedatu dam) issue can be resolved.""
With the two main Tamil Nadu parties Ã¢ÂÂ AIADMK and DMK Ã¢ÂÂ protesting in Parliament opposing the Mekedatu project, Karnataka lawmakers, cutting across party lines, have planned an agitation Thursday in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex to counter the two parties.
Tamil Nadu has been protesting the project after the Centre recently asked the Karnataka government to prepare a detailed project report for the Mekedatu dam.
The AIADMK and the DMK are agitating in both Houses of Parliament pressing for the scrapping of the proposed dam project.
The Tamil Nadu government has also appealed in the Supreme Court on the matter.
Kumaraswamy's brother and PWD Minister HD Revanna, as well as Karnataka Chief Secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar, were also present in the meeting in Delhi.
Besides, these two water disputes, the Karnataka chief minister also discussed with the Union minister about the pending national highway projects in the state.
He sought commencement of the construction of the six-lane Bengaluru-Mysuru Road, for which the Karnataka government has already acquired 85 per cent of the required land.
The chief minister requested Gadkari to direct the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to expedite preparation of the Detailed Project Report for construction of the Bengaluru-Hassan section of the NH-75, complete the work between Hassan to Gundya via Sakaleshpura (NH-75) and four-laning of the NH-206 from Tumkur-Honnavara.
He sought the construction of a four-lane divided carriageway between Hassan to Holenarasipur and sanction of a six-lane elevated highway in Hassan town limit on Belur-Bilikere of the NH-373.
Kumaraswamy also sought the upgradation of state highway from Channrayapatna-Holenarisipura-Arkalgudu-Kodlipet-Medikere as a national highway as it connects the Kannur International Airport which was opened very recently in Kerala.
The chief minister also demanded improvement and reconstruction of two lanes with paved shoulders from 456.35 kilometres to 489.84 kilometres from Belur to Hassan of the NH-374 as well as approval of strengthening of various roads required in view of taking upgradation of national highway NH-4 for inter-state connectivity.

Ã¢ÂÂThey [BJP government] had said they will bring many officers, but all they could bring was a paan, pakode and doodh government. This is the state of the youth in Rajasthan where 35 lakh people are unemployed,Ã¢ÂÂ he said while speaking in Jaipur.
Without naming his aunt, he lashed out at the government saying, Ã¢ÂÂthe price of garlic is R200 instead of R2,850. Bajra is supposed to be R1,950 according to the MSP. But today, the grain is not bought from the farmer and he has to struggle in the open market to sell it for R1,000.Ã¢ÂÂ

226,1544,positive,"Land acquisition for the expansion of Calicut International Airport has run into rough weather with the State government allegedly showing a lackadaisical attitude towards the proposal submitted by the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
The AAI had earlier requested the government to acquire 248 acres for the expansion of the runway and the construction of a new terminal. Later, this was reduced to 135 acres so that the terrain would be filled to increase the runway from its existing length of 2,700 m. The AAI had also committed to fund Ã¢ÂÂ¹1,000 crore for the expansion.
Subsequently, the government had asked the district collectors of Malappuram and Kozhikode to identify hills in these districts for landfilling. Now, with ecologists attributing the recent floods and landslips in the districts to rampant quarrying, the project would not take off, an AAI official said.
An estimate showed that Ã¢ÂÂ¹1,000 crore would be required to extend the runway. Nearly 120 to 150 lakh cubic metres of mud would be needed for the expansion of the airport. With such a whopping amount, AAI engineers believe, a new modern airport could be constructed.
At least 15.25 acres are also required for setting up a multi-level parking facility in front of the domestic terminal building. The request is also pending with the government.
AAI Chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra was supposed to hold discussions with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Chief Secretary Tom Jose in July. But this has been postponed indefinitely after the floods.
Immediate requirement
Calicut airport with its tabletop runway is located in 380 acres. What the airport immediately requires is an increase in the number of parking bays for aircraft. Currently, there are 13 parking bays, but in effect only 12 aircraft could be parked at a time. The operation of wide-bodied aircraft under Code E would complicate matters worse at the airport since the parking lots are designed in such a way that the parking of two Code E aircraft would reduce the bays to nine.
Already, the Director General of Civil Aviation has given approval for Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines), to operate Code E aircraft after the airline company submitted a safety and compatibility study. Its flights could possibly start operations next month. Air India has carried outs its study and the Dubai-based Emirates has also expressed its willingness to resume operations of its flights.
Many airline companies have sought permission for parking at night and Indigo wants to operate new schedules. Besides, the airport also needs to tackle the operation of unscheduled flights, sources said.",Land acquisition for Calicut airport runs into rough weather
227,1554,positive,"New Delhi, Oct 26 (PTI) Expressing concern over farm populism during elections, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu Friday said crop loan waiver cannot be a permanent solution for problems in the agri sector and a long term plan needs to be put in place to tackle new challenges in the sector.

His remarks come a day after the Congress reiterated its promise to waive all farm loans if the party came to power at the Centre in 2019.

Naidu also stressed that Parliament, political parties, think-tank Niti Aayog and media should pay more attention to farmers' issues amid the rising challenges of climate change and environment degradation in view of growing food demand. ""We have a clamour to populism to win over people during elections. That is not going to solve the problem (in agriculture sector). We have a clamour for free power. I am not in favour of free power. ...We also have the practice of asking for farm loan waiver. This cannot be a permanent solution,"" Naidu said at an event. Waiving crop loans for once will not solve the problem as farmers require credit every year. Political parties make promises during elections and some may fulfil it, but it is not a long-term solution, he said. ""Are there banks which lend money and never ask for repayment? ...My point is we have to think long term. Loan waiver cannot be a permanent solution. Farmers, scientists and policy makers should think seriously on this matter,"" he added. On another populist measure of free power supply to farmers, Naidu said, ""I am not in favour of free power. Free power means first low power and afterwards no power. No power means free power only. People want assured and quality power for 24X7. That is the need of the hour."" The vice president was here at an event to give away the USD 1,00,000 World Agriculture prize -- instituted by private body ICFA -- to renowned farm scientist M S Swaminathan for his outstanding contribution in the field of agriculture. Yesterday, while addressing the All India Kishan Khet Mazdoor Congress' rally, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had said: ""If the Congress assumes power at the Centre then our first major work will be to waive farmers' loan. (Party president) Rahul Gandhi has already announced this."" Emphasising the need to achieve the target of zero hunger by 2030, Naidu said the farm sector faces ""new problems and challenges"" in spite of best efforts by the governments in the last several years. ""Agriculture needs a big push in India and other parts of the country. It is obvious that concerted and coordinated efforts are needed on number of issues that impact growth of agriculture sector and quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector,"" he said. Lauding the contribution of Swaminathan to India's agriculture sector, Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said the country has come out of 'ship-to-mouth' situation and now become an exporter of agri-produce.

An agri-export policy has been drafted and will soon seek the Cabinet approval, he said, adding that there is a need to make agriculture more economically viable for farmers. Therefore, the focus should be on growing more food in less area and with less water, he added.

228,1556,positive,"In August, eight days after the Madras High Court granted an interim stay on land acquisition for the Chennai-Salem highway project, the Salem district administration organised a special camp to grant loans to residents whose properties were marked for acquisition.
Ã¢ÂÂThe officers began the meeting by convincing us to avail the special loans to build houses or start a business,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sivagami, a resident of Ramalingapuram village in Ayothiapattinam block. Ã¢ÂÂWe questioned the very intention of organising such an event especially when the interim stay order is in place.Ã¢ÂÂ
Two existing national highways connect the state capital to Salem district. However, the state announced in May that it would be acquiring 2,560 hectares of land in five districts to build a 277-km eight-lane highway called the Chennai-Salem corridor as part of the Central governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Bharatmala Pariyojana. In June, the official survey of the land took place under the police watch, provoking anger among farmers. Over three months, as the first part of this series reported, more than 60 farmers were arrested and several others detained before the Madras High Court intervened on August 21, granting an interim stay on the land acquisition.
The court was responding to a clutch of petitions filed by farmers, an environmental group called the Poovulagin Nanbargal, as well as public interest litigation filed by the political party, Pattali Makkal Katchi.
The petitioners argued that the highway project had been designed in a rush. The acquisition of agricultural lands threatened to compromise food security in the region and Ã¢ÂÂaffect very badly the livelihood sources of millions of the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ. They also pointed out that Ã¢ÂÂno demand has been made by people of Tamil Nadu for such a project in this area, since there are 3 major highway roads available from Chennai to SalemÃ¢ÂÂ.
SivagamiÃ¢ÂÂs family, for instance, is among the 350 families that had moved to Ramalingapuram village four years ago after their land and property was taken for National Highway-68 which connects Chennai to Salem via Ulundurpet. These families stand to be displaced again. Along with their homes, even a government high school and a temple will disappear.
The farmers affected by the project are largely from the most backward caste group of Vanniyars.
The division bench of Justices TS Sivagnanam and V Bhavani Subbaroyan placed a stay on the land acquisition Ã¢ÂÂconsidering the fact and the sensitivity of the matter and the category of persons from whom the lands are proposed to be acquiredÃ¢ÂÂ.
The High Court extended the interim stay again on September 14. By then, the authorities in all the five districts had completed the land survey, marked the properties to be acquired for the project and also the electric poles to be removed.
The authorities have even started the rehabilitation process in all five districts. This violates the 2013 land acquisition law which mandates that a social impact assessment be conducted in consultation with local residents to finalise a resettlement and rehabilitation plan.
Sivagami, a resident of Ramalingapuram, along with her neighbours walk through the agricultural field that will be acquired for corridor
Different laws
Most highway projects are executed under a different set of laws than industrial projects. Instead of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the government acquires land for national highways under the National Highways Act, 1956. The compensation, however, is determined based on the 2013 law Ã¢ÂÂ as the feasibility report of the Chennai-Salem corridor states. Even the rehabilitation and resettlement is done in accordance with the 2013 law.
Section 3A of the National Highways Act requires the government to publish a notification declaring its intent to acquire land for a highway in two local newspapers, one of which must be published in the regional language. Objections to the land acquisition can be filed with local authorities within 21 days from the date of the publication of the notification. Section 3D of the law states that in the event that no objections are filed, based on a report by the local authorities, the Central government can issue a notification enabling the land acquisition.
The Madras High Court clearly pronounced that the authorities should not issue a notification for the Chennai-Salem corridor under the National Highways Act, 1956, while the interim stay is in place. However, a senior official of Feedback Infra Private Limited, which had been hired by the National Highway Authority of India to prepare a detailed project report of the corridor, said: Ã¢ÂÂThe revenue department is now preparing the 3D notification. It will be published once the court gives us clearance.Ã¢ÂÂ
While the project director in the highway authorityÃ¢ÂÂs regional office in Chennai did not respond to Scroll.inÃ¢ÂÂs requests for an interview, the official of Feedback Infra Private Limited spoke to this reporter on the condition of anonymity. Ã¢ÂÂWe are confident that the project will be implemented though it might get delayed because of legal hurdles,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
Rehabilitation plans despite stay order
Even district officials are confident that the project will eventually go through. Not only have they organised camps to disburse loans, they have even given title deeds for alternative housing sites, as well as planned vocational training for those losing their land.
Such rehabilitation measures are premature and illegal.
Under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, rehabilitation needs to be done as per plans drawn up in consultation with people affected by the project. The law stipulates that when the government intends to acquire land for a public purpose, it shall carry out a social impact assessment study in consultation with the concerned panchayat, municipality or municipal corporation. Besides, the authorities have to prepare a draft rehabilitation and resettlement scheme, which should be made known locally by wide publicity in the affected area and discussed in the gram sabhas or municipalities. A public hearing needs to be conducted by giving adequate publicity about its date, time and venue.
None of this has happened yet. The senior official of Feedback Infra Private Limited confirmed that the social impact assessment study has been stopped because of the high court stay order.
Despite that, rehabilitation measures unilaterally planned by the government continue to be implemented.
In Salem, the district collector constituted a land acquisition coordination committee as early as May when the corridor project was first announced, said a senior officer in the revenue department, who did not want to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media. This committee comprises officials from nearly 20 different government departments, who have been asked to identify welfare schemes that can be used to rehabilitate the affected farmers. The committee meets every Monday to review the progress of the rehabilitation measures.
The rural development department is giving pattas or title deeds under the Chief Minister Solar Powered Green House Scheme to those losing their homes for the corridor project. As per the scheme, each house will be built over an area of 300 square feet at a cost of Rs 1.80 lakh. Ã¢ÂÂSo far, 48 pattas have been distributed to people whose properties will be acquired for the corridor in Salem district,Ã¢ÂÂ said the official. These were distributed before the stay placed by the High Court, he added.
When asked why camps were held after the land acquisition was stayed by the court, he said: Ã¢ÂÂThe court has stayed only the land acquisition process. The farmers might allege that we are brainwashing them but this has nothing to do with the preparations for the rehabilitation of the affected farmers.Ã¢ÂÂ
The district administration has also roped in industries to provide vocational training to those whose livelihood will be affected by the project. Apollo hospital, for instance, has been enlisted to provide training in nursing. Ã¢ÂÂThis is being done to ensure that affected people are rehabilitated,Ã¢ÂÂ the official said.
A burial ground in Chengum taluk lies in the path of the Chennai-Salem corridor.
While the Salem district administration has gone ahead distributing title deeds and charting out plans for rehabilitation and resettlement, the other four districts that lie in the path of the corridor were slowly catching up.
In Dharmapuri district, Chandra Kumar, a farmer, alleged that the administration invited the farmers losing their homes to the corridor and offered to distribute pattas for alternative housing sites. Ã¢ÂÂHowever, the farmers refused to take them,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
In Kancheepuram and Krishnagiri districts too, farmers alleged that the revenue department officials were Ã¢ÂÂbrainwashingÃ¢ÂÂ the project-affected families with different schemes and compensation offers.
Despite several attempts made by Scroll.in to contact them, the district collectors of Dharmapuri, Kancheepuram, Krishnagiri and Salem did not respond to calls and messages.
The district collector of Tiruvannamalai, KS Kandasamy, said the administration had completed the survey and marked the land to be acquired but had not published the details. Resettlement sites too had been identified. Ã¢ÂÂWe have formed a committee to look into the compensation package,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂWe will call for personal sitting with the farmers, hear them and customise the rehabilitation scheme based on their demands.Ã¢ÂÂ
However, farmers in all five districts questioned the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs move to draw up rehabilitation and resettlement plans when the highway project itself was on hold. Ã¢ÂÂWhen the officials visited our land to survey, they were persuading us to avail special loans and take up alternative employment opportunities,Ã¢ÂÂ said Narayanan, a farmer in Salem district. Ã¢ÂÂWho authorised them to do this? Let the government come out with an answer.Ã¢ÂÂ",Tamil Nadu government is flouting land acquisition law and court order

The moment tranquilliser dart hit her she charged at our open vehicle and to save life I had to shot her"" explained Asghar, a management graduate from UK's Leeds University.
His father Shafat Ali khan who belongs to Hyderabad's Nizam family expressed disappointment over Avni getting shot and said that the killing of man-eater was never on agenda.
""We had bought cages from Chandrapur's Tadoba reserve and arranged prey to nab T1. She had killed 13 human in past and there was fear among villagers. We had an expert team and all required authorisation for me and my son to kill the animal as guided by Supreme Court. But we never actually planned to kill her as capturing was the only thing in our mind,"" he said.
Shafat Ali Khan captured a maneater tigress alive last year near Brahmapuri in Maharashtra.
Tigress Avni, known as T1 by forest department, was shot dead on Friday night which triggered protests and wildlife activists alleging violation of norms during her killing.

230,1558,positive,"With the announced Assembly elections to the five States and the impending general elections, political parties are in competitive populism mode to announce farm loan waivers as a bait. However, the micro-reality suggests that crop loans, and hence waivers, are generally not provided to tenant farmers. The rise of tenant farming among small and marginal farmers also coincides with growing fragmentation of land.
The Reserve Bank data for March 2016 on farm credit (Basic Statistical Returns) show that 77 million agriculture credit accounts with SCBs (scheduled commercial bank) carry an average loan ticket of Ã¢ÂÂ¹1.16 lakh. Around 70 per cent of them are crop loans.
The contagion of waiver started with the first loan waiver in 1990 and again in 2008 from Government of India. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana followed suit in 2014 and Tamil Nadu in 2016. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka in 2018 waived farm loans with thresholds ranging from Ã¢ÂÂ¹1-2 lakh per farmer. Each waiver has its variants in terms of content and delivery.
Tenant farming risks also accentuate the demand for write-offs. Tenant farmersÃ¢ÂÂ loans are in the nature of gold loans and other forms of short-term credit, rather than crop loans.
Agriculture Ministry data pegging tenant farmers at 14 per cent of all farmers is a serious understatement, as more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are oral. Kerala is the only State that has a tenancy law in place with an implementation mechanism. Data on farmer suicides also confirm that they occur more among tenant farm holders and small and marginal land owners growing cash crops like cotton, than food or horticulture crops.
Combating credit risk in the farm sector rests more on crop diversification and cross-holding of risks between agriculture and allied activities, such as animal husbandry, than waiving bank loans.
Uneconomic holdings
According to NSSO (70th Round 2012-13), for the agricultural year 2012-13 rural India had an estimated total of 90.2 million agricultural households, which were about 57.8 per cent of the total estimated rural households during the same period. According to Agricultural Census 2010-11, 85 per cent of an estimated 138 million landholdings are marginal and small holdings as compared to a corresponding 62 per cent in 1960-61. The average size of small and marginal holdings was 1.42 hectare and 0.24 ha, respectively, in 2011-12.
Owing to fragmentation of land, the area operated by small and marginal farmers has increased from 19 per cent to 45 per cent of total cropped area in the last 50 years (1961-2011). This would mean that persons of small means and very low capacity to invest in technology and modern practices are engaged in agriculture.
Increase in farm labour costs by almost 100 per cent over the last decade directed the choice of product shifts in favour of labour saving crops. But these shifts did not favour the cause of land consolidation. Nor did they improve the marginal productivity of land. Even in regions of abundant labour supply, crops that do not require intensive input of labour and costly input of well irrigation are chosen.
In areas like coastal Andhra Pradesh that have a higher marginal productivity of land, tenant farming is of the order of 85 per cent of landholdings. This calls for a separate legislation to introduce loan eligibility cards for tenants.
Global examples
There are three successful farmer benefit programmes in vogue in the US since 2002: Annual Direct Payments; counter-cyclical payments if market prices are below the statutorily determined target prices (MSP); and loan deficiency payments or marketing loans that provide interim financing and additional income support if market prices fall below the statutorily determined prices.
These programmes provide a safety net to protect farmers from falling prices and raise farm income level but could raise land prices and concentrate on benefits to certain crops and producers. If agricultural insurance moves in tandem to cover the risks of farmerÃ¢ÂÂs life and crops, such distortions could be contained.
Second, pressure on land can be evened out if value addition initiatives are simultaneously financed. Telangana has experimented with the direct cash transfers ahead of the crop season with life insurance of the farmers, the premium for which was paid out of the treasury. Such experiments needed supportive infrastructure like trained extension staff and clean land records. Had the tenant farmers with a sworn affidavit of their terms of tenancy been covered, the experiment may have been more inclusive.

233,1580,positive,"Nagpur, MAHARASHTRA Ã¢ÂÂ Over one lakh farmers from all across the country are expected to participate in the Kisan Mukti March in the national capital on 29 and 30 November.
The march is being organised under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a confederation of around 200 farmers' groups from across the country.
According to the AIKSCC, the farmers will be joined by agricultural labourers and dispossessed rural Indians who have been hit hard by the agrarian crisis for over three decades now.
The 'Dilli Chalo' march also has a well-updated website, and the organisers claim that it is receiving support from different sections of the society.
Senior journalist P Sainath, who is also traveling across the country to mobilise support for the march, said that the idea for the march came from the Nashik-to-Mumbai farmers' march earlier this year.
That march was exceptionally well-organised and saw the middle class of the city come out on to the roads to support the farmers and provide them with food and other necessities.

""When was the last time people from the middle classes interacted with the farmers? The great thing about Nashik-Mumbai march was that it started happening. Middle classes started reconnecting. I think this is a very important thing and it goes beyond 29 or 30 November that the farmers and the labourers are returning into public discourse and the middle classes are talking to peoplefrom the Anganwadis, to people from the farms, to agricultural labourers. It's a good thing for democracy, it's a good thing for equality,"" Sainath told HuffPost India.
The main demand of the farmers' is a 21-day-long joint parliamentary session dedicated to the agrarian crisis.
The farmers will gather at the Ram Leela Maidan in New Delhi on 29 November and march towards Parliament the next day to demand that two private member bills be passed and a special session of the Parliament be called. The two bills are The Farmers Freedom from Indebtedness Bill, 2018 and Farmers' Right to Guaranteed Remunerative Minimum Support Price for Agricultural Commodities Bill, 2018.
""We are making a determined attempt to reach out to all sections of people across India because the agrarian crisis ultimately affects everyone. Our attempt is to generate an understanding of the long historical processes, especially of the past two decades, that has precipitated the agrarian crisis,"" the 'Dilli Chalo' website states.
The 'Dilli Chalo' march will likely put the Narendra Modi government on the defensive as it is one of the biggest mobilisations against it since the government assumed charge in 2014.
Many civil society groups, political parties, and the Delhi government have also extended their support to this march.

It has also announced campaigns, demonstrations and protest sit-ins on the issue at all districts across the country between October 22 and 28.

AHMEDABAD: The friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu , was apparent when they interacted with farmers in Vadrad village of Prantij taluka in Sabarkantha at the Centre of Excellence for Vegetables . Both leaders batted for use of scientific methods to increase farmersÃ¢ÂÂ income.Modi, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara Netanyahu, also visited the nursery at Vadrad centre before meeting farmers.In his speech, Netanyahu started by thanking Modi in Hindi. Ã¢ÂÂDhanyavaad mere pyaare dostÃ¢ÂÂ (thanks my dear friend),Ã¢ÂÂ Netanyahu said. Both leaders stressed the use of modern technology which can also strengthen Indo-Israel relationship benefiting farmers of India.Ã¢ÂÂWe come from a land which was a desert,Ã¢ÂÂ the Israeli PM said. Ã¢ÂÂWe were farmers at the time of the Bibles. We raised dates, weeds, olives but the land lay barren. We started scientific agriculture and saw our yields increase and water usage go down. We saw crop survival and it survived much longer in storage,Ã¢ÂÂ Netanyahu said.He further said that they had implemented the programme called, Mashav, in many countries but its biggest use was being made here in India.Ã¢ÂÂWe have 20 such centres of excellence and soon we will have 30 such centres,Ã¢ÂÂ said the PM of Israel.Ã¢ÂÂWe want India to help itself because India has vision. India has a leader who understands that knowledge is the future. Knowledge with purpose - this is the policy of Narendra Modi. This is my policy too. We can do a lot together,Ã¢ÂÂ Netanyahu said.Mashav is the Hebrew acronym for Israel's agency for International Development Cooperation which was established as a division of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was started to focus on grassroots-level human capacity building at a time when Israel itself was still a developing country. Mashav has been developed as an extensive programme of cooperation throughout the developing world with the aim of ensuring social, economic and environmental sustainable development.Modi also acknowledged that transformation of agriculture had taken place in Israel through scientific technology.Ã¢ÂÂIsrael shows the way on how to transform a nation with the agriculture sector at the core. It is important to use latest technology when it comes to agriculture. Farmers gain immensely from use of technology,Ã¢ÂÂ Modi said. He further said that India is working to double farmersÃ¢ÂÂ incomes by 2022.Ã¢ÂÂFor this, optimum utilisation of land resources, minimum wastage and understanding the needs of the market become important.

238,1617,positive,"IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs critically endangered tiger population is soaring, a success for conservation policies, but the animals are being crowded out in a competition with humans for territory.
PANDHARKAWADA, India Ã¢ÂÂ The first victim was an older woman, discovered facedown in a cotton field with huge claw marks dug into her back. The next was an older male farmer, his left leg torn off.
The killings have gone on for more than two years, sowing panic in the hills around Pandharkawada, a town in central India. In mid-August, the mauled body of Vaghuji Kanadhari Raut, a cattle herder, was found near a rural highway. He was victim No. 12.
DNA tests, camera traps, numerous sightings and pugmarks Ã¢ÂÂ tiger footprints Ã¢ÂÂ have pinned at least 13 human killings on a single, 5-year-old female tiger that seems to have developed a taste for human flesh and has evaded capture several times.
At night, young men in the nearby villages carry torches and bamboo sticks and go on patrol. They have roughed up forest guards, furious that authorities canÃ¢ÂÂt stop the killings.
Experts say itÃ¢ÂÂs extremely unusual for a single tiger to have attacked this many people. IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs critically endangered tiger population is soaring, a success for conservation policies, but the animals are being crowded out in a competition with humans for territory.
Forest rangers are gearing up for a complex military-style operation to deploy sharpshooters with tranquilizer guns on the backs of half a dozen elephants to surround the tiger, capture her and send her to a zoo.
But the elephants have yet to arrive, held up by intense bureaucratic infighting among IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs myriad overlapping government agencies that cover wildlife but, among all of them, still donÃ¢ÂÂt seem to have enough resources.
As the death count rises Ã¢ÂÂ three villagers were killed in August Ã¢ÂÂ several politicians are demanding that the rangers simply shoot the tiger. But that might not be legal. A wildlife activist seeking to block any such order has taken the matter to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Supreme Court, which may hear the case soon.
In the meantime, rangers have been posted on rickety wooden stands built into jungle trees and ordered to keep their eyes peeled for the tiger. But they donÃ¢ÂÂt even have binoculars.
Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt want to kill this beautiful animal,Ã¢ÂÂ said K.M. Abharna, a top forestry official in the Pandharkawada area, near the borders of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh states. Ã¢ÂÂBut thereÃ¢ÂÂs a hell of a lot of political pressure and a hell of a lot of public pressure.Ã¢ÂÂ
Tiger country
A crafty man-eating tiger on the loose sounds like something out of a Rudyard Kipling tale. But itÃ¢ÂÂs a real and growing problem in modern India.
The countryÃ¢ÂÂs effort to protect tigers, in a way, is a victim of its own success. Closer monitoring, new technology and stricter wildlife policies have led to a sharp increase in the tiger count, from 1,411 in 2006 to an estimated 2,500 today Ã¢ÂÂ more than half of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs approximately 4,000 tigers. This growth is causing increased conflict.
IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs human population and its economy also have been rapidly growing, steadily filling in rural areas with farms, roads and mushrooming towns like Pandharkawada. Many tigers are running out of space.
They are spilling out of their dedicated reserves, roaming along smooth new asphalt highways and skulking through crowded farmland on a search for territory, mates and prey Ã¢ÂÂ such as antelope, wild pigs, stray cattle and sometimes people.
Across India, islands of forest are shrinking, and the thin green tendrils on the map Ã¢ÂÂ tiger corridors Ã¢ÂÂ are being cut by more roads and more farms. Tigers are intensely territorial: A male tiger, once it gets big enough, might kill its own mother over turf.
Each tiger needs miles of thick forest; the size of its territory depends on the availability of prey. In the past decade, India has created nearly two dozen more tiger reserves, bringing the total to 50. But many of them are surrounded by human development on all sides.
Ã¢ÂÂOur tiger situation is not a success story, itÃ¢ÂÂs a mess,Ã¢ÂÂ said Valmik Thapar, one of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs most renowned tiger experts. Ã¢ÂÂWe have a whole bunch of islands, and the corridors in between are wiped out or degraded. Many tiger reserves are nonstarters, with less than five tigers or none at all. And weÃ¢ÂÂre too arrogant to learn from anywhere else.Ã¢ÂÂ
The restrictions on the beef industry in many parts of India could be making the situation even more dangerous. IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Hindu nationalist governing party, the BJP, has cracked down like no other Indian government on the slaughter of cows, an animal Hindus revere.
This has created enormous herds of mangy, unproductive, unwanted cattle that herders donÃ¢ÂÂt dare to kill, either because of specific cow-protection laws that vary state by state or because they are terrified of being lynched by Hindu extremists.
In several tiger areas, more prey now lives outside the dedicated tiger reserve than inside. That may be luring tigers out.
Ã¢ÂÂAs soon as the tiger comes out, he sees a lot of cattle,Ã¢ÂÂ explained Bilal Habib, an ecology professor and tiger researcher. So the tiger decides to stick around, Bilal said, catalyzing a whole cycle of conflict and death.
Friction with farms
In the case of the man-eating tiger, researchers are at a loss to explain why she started attacking humans. She has also killed some cows and horses.
The rangers call her T-1. They have been keeping track of her since she was a cub; when she was young, they say, her mother was electrocuted. This is another growing problem, as farmers in India string up crude electric fences to keep wild pigs out of their crops.
T-1 never lived in a dedicated tiger reserve; 30 percent of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs tigers donÃ¢ÂÂt. Instead, they inhabit forested areas that are somewhat protected (for example, people are not supposed to build villages inside them).
Her first victims were farmers weeding their fields at the forestÃ¢ÂÂs edge. In this part of India, everything is so packed together that even the people who live here arenÃ¢ÂÂt sure where the agricultural land ends and the protected forests begin.
According to charts that forestry officials have been keeping, T-1 has eaten the flesh of about half of her victims. She gnawed off one womanÃ¢ÂÂs legs cleanly at the knees, almost like a chain saw. She chewed into one manÃ¢ÂÂs back, leaving his spinal column exposed.
The rangers took swabs of tiger saliva from the wounds and sent them to labs for DNA analysis. Over several months, as the results came in, they began to piece together what they were facing.
In January, forestry officials applied for what is called a shoot order. But an animal-rights activist from Mumbai who objected to killing T-1 helped to block it. Then T-1 gave birth to two fuzzy cubs, which meant any action taken against her could jeopardize them, too.
So the rangers equipped themselves with nets and tranquilizer guns and fanned out into the jungles, full of pungent lantana bushes, old gnarled teak trees and clouds of dragonflies hovering in the thick, humid air. Four times, they tried to capture T-1.
Ã¢ÂÂBut sheÃ¢ÂÂs very wild,Ã¢ÂÂ said Abharna, the forestry official. Ã¢ÂÂAnd sheÃ¢ÂÂs very clever.Ã¢ÂÂ
Each time, she either hid in the tangle of lantana bushes or raced away.
The villagers who live in T-1Ã¢ÂÂs area, which covers about 60 square miles, havenÃ¢ÂÂt been especially helpful. Furious that the rangers wonÃ¢ÂÂt simply shoot the tiger, they have blocked access to the jungle. Others devised disturbing plans of their own.
Every time a tiger kills someone, authorities pay compensation to the victimÃ¢ÂÂs family, sometimes as much as $14,000. ItÃ¢ÂÂs part of a government program to assuage grieving relatives so they donÃ¢ÂÂt try to take revenge against endangered tigers.
During a capture operation, an older man who could barely walk positioned himself right next to a cage that the rangers had baited with fresh buffalo meat.
Ã¢ÂÂWhen we asked him what in the world he was doing,Ã¢ÂÂ said Abharna, he replied: Ã¢ÂÂIf I die, will you give my family the money?Ã¢ÂÂ
As the forestry officials wrestle over what to do, wildlife activists keep returning to court to block shoot orders. The activists say the tiger is simply defending her cubs, and the victims ventured into her territory. They are trying to compel the forestry department to tranquilize T-1 and move her to another area. The Supreme Court may hear the case within days.
The people living near Pandharkawada are losing patience. And they are becoming increasingly terrified.

239,1618,positive,"The Supreme Court has ordered the West Bengal government to respond to a case of 27 farmers, who are fighting to retain their land against the StateÃ¢ÂÂs claim of having acquired it over six decades ago.
Srikanta Charan Kanp, the lead petitioner in the case, told an apex court Bench of Justices A.M. Sapre and Indu Malhotra that his family has been cultivating the land for generations. They got the shock of their life when local authorities summoned them in 2015 and told them that the 35 acres they were farming at Guria village in Purba Medinipur district was not theirs but belonged to the State Public Works Department (PWD).
The authorities claimed there was an acquisition proceeding under the West Bengal Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1948, about 67 years ago, when Kanp and his co-petitioners were mere children. The land was turned over to the government for a Ã¢ÂÂbrick fieldÃ¢ÂÂ. It was then, years later, vested with the PWD.
Mr. Kanp told the Bench about their desperate search for Ã¢ÂÂscrapsÃ¢ÂÂ of information about this acquisition. He said the farmers had to search their homes for any documents or records about such an acquisition as the, Ã¢ÂÂState authority failed to produce any document in support of the completion of the acquisition proceeding, including the passing of the award and payment of compensation.Ã¢ÂÂ Finally, when their search drew a blank and the authorities resorted to force to evict them, the farmers approached the courts.
The Calcutta High Court, however, in September this year, concluded that the farmers had woke up too late. The HC said the State had duly notified the acquisition in the gazette published in 1950, the record of rights had changed, and the acquisition proceedings had culminated in an award.
In their appeal before the apex court, the farmers argued that neither did the State take possession of their land nor was any compensation paid to them. If the acquisition had happened during the time of their fathers or grandfathers, the subsequent generations had continued to inherit and hold the land as its owners.
Ã¢ÂÂThough acquisition proceeding [was] initiated 67 years back for the purpose of [a] brick field but not possession was taken by the Land Acquisition Collector and no award was passed and no compensation was paid as per statute hence said proceeding has been lapsed by operation of law,Ã¢ÂÂ the petition contended.
Ã¢ÂÂPetitionerÃ¢ÂÂs father and forefathers were owners of the land in questionÃ¢ÂÂ¦ After the expiry of their father and forefathers, they have become the owners of the respective plots of land by way of inheritance, and they are in possession and cultivating the said land in question since, long without any interruption from any corner,Ã¢ÂÂ it said.
The farmers argued that the handing over of the land to the PWD was, Ã¢ÂÂabsolutely illegalÃ¢ÂÂ and sought that it be set aside. irregular, arbitrary, mala fide and motivated and, as a result, the said impugned vesting order is liable to be cancelled and/or set aside.Ã¢ÂÂ
Recently, in a separate writ petition filed by activist Medha Patkar, the court decided to examine the legality of amendments brought in by the Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra, Telangana and Jharkhand governments, which allegedly allow forcible acquisition of land for both private and public infrastructure projects in alleged violation of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in the Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013.
Ms. Patkar argued that the StatesÃ¢ÂÂ amendments Ã¢ÂÂemasculateÃ¢ÂÂ the spirit and legislative intent of the 2013 Act to give farmers and land owners a complete say in the acquisition and compensation for loss of land.",Land acquisition: 27 farmers move Supreme Court against West Bengal government

Gujarat forest officials have come out with a Ã¢ÂÂnewÃ¢ÂÂ way to catch the Ã¢ÂÂman-eaterÃ¢ÂÂ leopard in the Dhanpur taluka of Dahod district. This time three officials spent four hours on Friday night in a cage, that was put in the forest range, to catch the big cat that has killed three persons in the area. The three men, forest guard Vijay Bamania, an official trained to shoot tranquiliser darts, and a veterinary doctor were put in one of the nine cages the department has placed in the forest where the leopard is said to be moving, with the eight other cages spread through the jungle containing animals. The officials returned to the cage Saturday evening.
While officials have admitted that this a new way to catch the animal, Chief Conservator of Forests, Vadodara Circle, S K Shrivastava, supervisor of the current mission, said that once in a while such experimentation is needed, The Indian Express reported.
The team inside the cage had a torch, while a goat was tied in the open nearby. They also had a machine to make goat sounds to attract the leopard. Around their position, dry leaves have been scattered so that they could hear the leopard coming. Officials have said that the all three inside were safe and the cage was like Ã¢ÂÂa protection cageÃ¢ÂÂ.

This development comes after the officials failed to catch the leopard when they placed goats inside the cage as bait. According to The Indian Express, Shrivastava admitted that the humans-in-cage idea followed their thwarted efforts to track the leopard lately.
As many as 200 Forest Department officials are prowling the forest range of Dhanpur in a bid to capture the leopard, including a team from Sasan Gir.
Following the deaths and attacks, the local villagers had demanded shoot-at-sight orders against the leopard.
Even as the leopard is out of the reach of officials, at the same time, they suspect the big cat could have moved out to Alirajpur forests in Madhya Pradesh.
Despite their efforts, the forest personnel in Gujarat could not capture the Ã¢ÂÂman-eaterÃ¢ÂÂ big cat, even ten days after it killed two children and an elderly woman in different forest areas in the taluka, the official said.

LUCKNOW: In all 19 persons were arrested on Sunday against three FIRs lodged in connection with the violence, rioting and killing of head constable Suresh Vats in Ghazipur on Saturday. Moreover, 22 persons were detained by the district police and interrogation was on in the case, said the police sources here on Sunday.
According to Director General of Police (DGP) OP Singh, 11 of 19 persons were held for killing the constable and rest 8 for violence and trouble making. Total 32 persons were named in the FIR lodged for VatsÃ¢ÂÂ murder.
Notably, head constable Suresh Vats (48) was killed on Saturday when protesters of Nishad Party, an ally of Samajwadi Party, hurled stones at vehicles returning after attending Prime Minister Narendra Modi public rally in Ghazipur. The slain head constable sustained a grievous injury when a stone hurled at him by the angry mob hit him on head. The cop was leading a police team to end the traffic jam by evicting Nishads who had squatted on state highway while protesting in support of their demand for reservation. They were also demanding the district administration to release three of their aides.
On the other, the bereaved son of the slain cop, said the compensation provided by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was meaningless as he would not get his father back with it. He also deplored the state police for its failure to protect its own in face of violence.
In UP, murder of Vats is the second such incident within a month. Early on December 3, inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was killed by an angry mob in Bulandshahr. Inspector Singh was shot when he trying to placate the mob of villagers protesting over alleged cow slaughter.
Confirming the arrest of around a dozen persons for killing the cop, ADG Varanasi zone, PV Rama Sastry said that according to the Ghazipur CMO, the reason of death of the constable was believed to be head injury. Around 70-80 unidentified persons were booked for stone pelting and violence. Meanwhile, Ghazipur Superintendent of Police, Yashveer Singh claimed that protesters were workers of the Rashtriya
Nishad Party who were prevented by the administration and the police from going to the rally venue as they moving towards it.
""After the PM left Ghazipur, the protestors blocked traffic at various places and started pelting stones on the vehicles returning from the programme venue,"" said the SP. He added that to zero in the culprits video footages of the incident were being scanned.
Directing the district magistrate and the superintendent of police to take strict action against unruly elements and arrest them immediately, CM Yogi Adityanath had announced a compensation of Rs 40
lakh for the wife of Vats and Rs 10 lakh for his parents, the state has government said. Meanwhile, slamming the state government for alleged lawlessness, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav attributed the incident to CM Yogi's encounter policy. Ã¢ÂÂWhether he is in his office or on stage, he only supports encounters,Ã¢ÂÂ said Yadav
The unfortunate incident that happened on Saturday in Ghazipur could have been averted by the administration had it been alert, said the SP chief . Ã¢ÂÂAlso the local intelligence might have had inputs
about the planned protest. Even then the administration was busy with the PMÃ¢ÂÂs programme and failed to assess the situation,"" Yadav said.","19 persons held, 11 for killing constable, 8 for unrest in Ghazipur"
242,1646,positive,"Nikhil Bagdi has attempted suicide twice in the past one month. Fortunately, his neighbours came to his rescue whenever he tried to end his life by hanging from the ceiling of his room. Nikhil lives in Serorai village of Bardhaman district in West Bengal, a little over 120 kilometres from Kolkata.
The 55-year-old says that he has taken a loan of Rs three lakh from a private money lender to cultivate paddy in the 10 bighas of land he had got on lease from a farmer. But almost eight bighas of land got destroyed due to inadequate rains this year.
He has no money even to take diesel-run pump sets on rent to draw groundwater for his fields. He fears that it is just a matter of time before another two bighas meet a similar fate. Nikhil, like a bonded labourer, is rearing the cattle of the farmer who had given him the land on lease at a monthly salary of just Rs 100.
Ã¢ÂÂI decided to take the extreme step because the shortage of water for crops has led to huge losses. I loaned the money for farming by mortgaging my wifeÃ¢ÂÂs jewellery to a private money lender as banks refuse to sanction loans. I do not have resources even to use cello pumps for groundwater. The crops are dying with each passing day and I am witnessing the ruin helplessly. It will all be over within a few days,Ã¢ÂÂ he says tearing up at the thought.
Farmers suffer as groundwater declines
He is not alone in this misery. Thousands of farmers in Bardhaman district of West Bengal, particularly in Galsi block-I are suffering huge losses due to the shortage of water. To add to their woes is the apathy of the administration that has remained indifferent to their plight so far.
The condition of Bardhaman farmers is alarming because the region is hailed as the rice bowl of West Bengal contributing to the stateÃ¢ÂÂs recognition of being the largest producer of rice in the country.
In 2014-15, West Bengal had topped the list of rice-producing states with 14677.2 thousand tonnes of rice production. The average rice productivity in West Bengal stands at about 2,500 kg per hectare.
Of the three varietiesÃ¢ÂÂAus, Aman and BoroÃ¢ÂÂthe Aman crop accounts for 68.65 percent of the total agricultural land and 33.47 percent of the total rice production in Bengal.
Farmers are facing a severe water crisis this season because rainfall during September has been 180.8 mm, far below the normal of 279.4 mm. Most of the farmers here are small and marginal farmers who canÃ¢ÂÂt afford diesel-run pump sets, given its spiralling prices.
The situation has reached such a point that vast fields of paddy crops that normally remained drenched in water have become dry and the earth has cracked from the scorching heat.
Farmers who have managed to arrange diesel sets have to cough up around Rs 5,000 for every 40-50 hours of water drawn from the ground Ã¢ÂÂWe have to pay Rs 100 for every one hour to the diesel set owners that excludes the rent of pipes used to supply water to the fields. We have no alternative but to shell extra in order to save the crops. The buyers, however, wonÃ¢ÂÂt pay us more,Ã¢ÂÂ rues Atiar Sha (45) who has 30 bighas of land but had to mortgage four bighas to arrange money for cultivation.
He says that farmers who were also involved in fishing are drying up their ponds to utilise the water for farming. Ã¢ÂÂThey have no alternative because a loss in paddy farming could reduce them to being beggars and might force them to end their lives. Most of the fish have died as water from the ponds is being used for agriculture but even that is falling short of the requirement.Ã¢ÂÂ
An apathetic administration adds to their woes
It is not just nature, the administrative laxity too is responsible for their plight. The farmers depend on the water released from the DVC and Massanjore dams in this rice-producing belt. The 27-km-long canal that supplies water from the dam to the agricultural fields is in a state of disrepair with water leakage at several places. Ã¢ÂÂThe leakage in the canal has led to the loss of water but nothing is being done to repair it. The water from the dam can bring some respite but its poor condition has further aggravated our problems,Ã¢ÂÂ complains Noor Mohammad Mollah (40), a local farmer.
The administration had also promised them solar-run submersible pumps to lift groundwater but the assurance has so far remained only on papers.
Angry over the indifference of the state government, hundreds of farmers had blocked National Highway 2B connecting Bardhaman and Bolpur for about four hours on October 6 demanding canal water for the crop. Carrying bottles of poison, the agitating farmers threatened to commit suicide if their crops get affected.
When asked about their condition, the pradhan of the Serorai gram panchayat Sk Abdul says, Ã¢ÂÂWe do not have electricity to run solar pumps in the fields. There is nothing to worry for the farmers as the fields are getting adequate water. The crop will be good this year.Ã¢ÂÂ
Conceding that farmers are going through troubled times, the deputy director of agriculture department, Jagannath Chatterjee blames inadequate rainfall for their woes. Ã¢ÂÂWe have received around 800 mm of rainfall this season against the average of 1200 mm received every year. There has been a shortage of 30 percent of rainfall, this year. Moreover, the catchment areas of river Damodar in Bihar and Jharkhand have also received lesser rainfall. We are trying to find alternative ways to provide water to the farmers.Ã¢ÂÂ

The mysterious killings were first reported in Churachandpur district in the last week of October. Rampant reports of attacks on domestic animals including chicken, ducks, pigs and sheeps have led locals to maintain night vigil, which reportedly stopped the attack in the area.
But the incidents of attacks on animal started again in the last few days, and this time spreading across the state.
Ã¢ÂÂApart from Churachandpur, there have been instances of killings from Imphal East, Kangpokpi, Thoubal, Kakching districts,Ã¢ÂÂ said ManipurÃ¢ÂÂs Forest and Environment Minister T Shyamkumar.
He stated that the Department along with the officials of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Department and Wildlife experts conducted a meeting over the incident.
Informing that experts have already taken footprints of the suspected predator, he said that the footprints are being studied by animal experts.
Preliminary report suggests the predator may be a canine animal, though the final report is awaited. Stating that previously there had been no report of such incidents, he said as a preventive measure the Forest Department has formed a team to catch the predator at the earliest.
A Special Surveillance Team was formed comprising of police, district authority, CSOs and others. The initial autopsy reports, conducted on some of the carcasses found in Churachandpur, suggested that the attack was carried out by sharp teeth of an animal.
Meanwhile, reports of locals attacking wild animals like civets have emerged. Earlier this week, residents of Imphal East killed a civet, suspecting it to be behind the killings.
Shyamkumar said his ministry had contacted the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, to check if Ã¢ÂÂit was the natureÃ¢ÂÂ of civets to attack domestic animals in the fashion witnessed in Manipur in the last month. Ã¢ÂÂWe have also sent the footprints of the animal found in some places to forensic experts,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

On the seventh day of the festival this year, immersion of idols created havoc as thousands of dead turtles and fishes washed ashore on Dadar and Juhu beaches. The reason behind this mass death of marine animals is due to the Plaster Of Paris (PoP) that is used in preparing the idols, the lead in their paints and the nirmalya (flower offerings) that are immersed, notes the Mumbai Mirror.

On 14th September, the young army worked hard to scan the beaches, collecting broken pieces of the idols with utmost care and later handing them over to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, the logical Indian reported.

Speaking to Mumbai Mirror, Kwatra said that water snakes and fish had died due to the toxic chemicals that were present inside the PoP idols, as well as the overload of bacteria that resulted due to the immersion of flowers, prasad and other offerings into the sea.

He went onto say that the paint on the idols contains chromium, lead, aluminium and copper, which dissolve and turn into toxic compounds in water. This damages the gills of the fish, the most important organ from which the fishes breathe.

On Friday, Kwatra and other volunteers who have designated themselves as Ã¢ÂÂbeach warriorsÃ¢ÂÂ picked up around 95 such idols that were thrown away on the Dadar beach. They were returned to the BMC to turn them into chalk.

BHOPAL: A 60-year-old deputy ranger of forest department was crushed to death by a tractor ferrying illegally mined sand in Morena district, Madhya Pradesh , on Friday morning. Police have registered a murder case.This is the same place where a young IPS officer, Narendra Kumar, was crushed to death in March 2012, while trying to check illegal mining. Three constables Atwal Singh Chouhan, Dharmendra Chouhan and Narendra Sharma also lost their lives in separate incidents in a short span while trying to check sand miners.the deceased has been identified as Subedar Singh Kushwah, a resident of Bhind district. He was posted at the Ghorna forest chowki under Civil Line police station area Ã¢ÂÂ located on Dholpur highway, 5 km from the Morena district headquarters, for the last two years.KushwahÃ¢ÂÂs retirement was due in June 2018 but he got extension under the new retirement policy introduced by Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, raising age limit from 60 years to 62.Ã¢ÂÂTwo people on motorcycle were trying to remove tyre bursting spikes that were kept on road by forest officials to stop tractors and trucks ferrying illegal sand. When Kushwah tried to stop them, he was hit by the speeding tractor from behind,Ã¢ÂÂ Morena SP Amit Sanghi told TOI adding a case of murder has been registered against the accused.Those on motorcycle were escorting the tractor and are said to be associated with sand mining mafia. Forest officials had been using locally-designed spike strips or spike boards to impede or stop the movement of tractors puncturing their tires. In Morena it was a metal plate studded with spikes.Kushwah was on duty along with four other employees of the forest department when he spotted tractors ferrying illegally mined sand around 10.30 am. Sources say Kushwah got crushed under the wheels as he tried to stop the tractor. Incident has reportedly been captured in a CCTV camera.Ã¢ÂÂSubedar Singh Kushwah got killed in a bid to stop the tractor. He died on the spot while person driving the tractor escaped,Ã¢ÂÂ said forest guard Bhagwan, who was at the spot.Illegal mining of stones and stone slabs is rampant in Morena and Bhind districts of Chambal region bordering Uttar Pradesh . IPS Narendra Kumar was killed while trying to stop a tractor trolley ferrying illegally mined stone in Morena district. Sand mining mafia is active in almost all MP districts, destroying river beds those get dried up in winter and peak summer. Many rivers in the state are facing threat due to rampant illegal mining in the state.NGT had been pulling up Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for the illegal sand mining going around MorenaÃ¢ÂÂs National Chambal Sanctuary, but state government has failed to control the mining activities. NGT had taken cognisance of a petition filed by NGO Tiger Protection Group which sought prevention of sand mining in and around the sanctuary claiming that the menace was contributing in destruction of the gharial habitat as the sandbanks are essential for its nesting purposes. Tribunal was informed that by large-scale illegal mining activities in these state, species of Gharial and red-crowned turtle are likely to become extinct.In June, 18 members of a family on their way to a condolence meet were killed and five others were injured when a tractor-trolley ferrying illegally-mined sand rammed into their jeep in Morena near Ganjrampur village.

252,1733,positive,"Summer has just set in but Gujarat is already facing a water shortage. And it will only worsen in the next two months as the StateÃ¢ÂÂs main water sources like the Narmada dam, and dozens of other dams and reservoirs, are going dry. Ironically, Gujarat is faced with the crisis despite copious rains last monsoon.

The government has assured that there will be no shortage of drinking water in any corner of the State. Narmada water was stopped for irrigation from March 15. Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Parbat Patel recently told the Assembly that the State has made adequate arrangements to ensure drinking water is available in every part of the State. But the picture is far from that. A crisis is already evident in villages, where water is now supplied once or twice a week.

Despite the StateÃ¢ÂÂs claimed preparations, approximately 4,238 out of 18,000 villages in Gujarat are facing a severe crisis as their sources have either gone dry or are about to go dry. Ã¢ÂÂMore than 50% of the hand pumps in tribal pockets are not functional. Small tribal villages from north to central Gujarat are the worst hit,Ã¢ÂÂ said Congress spokesman Manish Doshi.

Currently, the water level in the StateÃ¢ÂÂs main water body, the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada, is at about 105 metres, roughly less than 50% of the damÃ¢ÂÂs normal average level. Moreover, the spread of water in the reservoir, which was across 214 km during the monsoon, has now shrunk to less than 90 km, and will shrink further in the summer. Now, the State is forced to use the dead stock of water from the dam.

The Narmada is the main source of water for over 10,000 villages and 165 towns and cities in over a dozen districts in the State, notably in the water-starved and drought-prone Saurashtra, Kutch and north Gujarat regions. Moreover, in all other 203 dams and reservoirs across the State, the water level is less than 40%, and will dry up rapidly as summer peaks. A look at the region-wise figures of water storage available in the StateÃ¢ÂÂs dams: 15 dams in north Gujarat have 714.95 mcm (million cubic metres) storage, which is 37.15%. In 138 dams and water bodies in Saurashtra, only 656.97 mcm water is stored, which is just 25.93 %.

On January 22, the State government announced that water in the Narmada dam had reached its lowest level in the last 13 years. So, from mid-March, Narmada water will not be supplied for irrigation. The State has now deployed State Reserved Police (SRP) personnel along the canals to stop farmers from taking water illegally from the Narmada canals.

After stopping water for irrigation, the outflow of water has come down from around 9,000 cusecs early this week to around 4,900 cusecs now, with 4,300 cusecs for drinking purposes.

Worse ahead

Ã¢ÂÂMore than 50% villages in my area are facing water shortage and it will become more acute in April and May,Ã¢ÂÂ said Congress legislator Naushad Solanki from the Dasada constituency in Saurashtra. Ã¢ÂÂEarlier, the government said no shortage in drinking water because the Narmada dam water has been reserved for drinking purposes and irrigation supply was curtailed. However, now, even drinking water supply is inadequate in villages,Ã¢ÂÂ said Sagar Rabari of the Gujarat FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Union, a civil society group fighting for farmersÃ¢ÂÂ rights.

Authorities have started rationalised supply to cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara in order to supply more water to smaller towns and villages. Ã¢ÂÂIn Ahmedabad, which receives 1,420 million litres per day (MLD) from the Narmada and Kadana dams, among other resources, water supply is expected to be cut by 200 MLD,Ã¢ÂÂ a senior official in the State government said. South Gujarat has 27% less water compared to last year so there is an urgent need to rationalise use of water in Surat, which gets the highest water supply per capita, he added.

The crisis seems to have its genesis upstream. According to State government officials, due to a weak monsoon in the Narmada catchment areas in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat could only get 4.71 million acre feet (maft) of water, which is just 45% of the sanctioned supply of 9 maft is awarded by the Narmada Tribunal to the State.",Summer of discontent: water crisis looms in Gujarat

254,1737,positive,"For the first time, the Joint Doctrine of the Indian Armed Forces acknowledges that the Ã¢ÂÂenvironment has emerged as a critical area of the security paradigm,Ã¢ÂÂ and warns that if environmental degradation and related issues increase security risks, the military will need to respond. Released in 2017, the doctrine lists a series of non-traditional security challenges linked to the environment that could influence conflict and war, including Ã¢ÂÂclimate change, ecosystem disruption, energy issues, population issues, food-related problems, economic issues of unsustainable modes of production, and civil strife related to environment.Ã¢ÂÂ While the military has taken steps to address its impacts on the environment, it can do much more to support the nationÃ¢ÂÂs environmental goals and mitigate environment-related security risks.

Why Is the Indian Military Concerned About Environmental Security?

The Indian military has recently begun to look more closely at the impact of environmental change on its tactics, operations, and strategy. This change in approach was triggered by the devastation wrought by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on the Car Nicobar Air Force Base, and by more recent events, including 2014Ã¢ÂÂs Cyclone Hudhud, which wrecked the air base at IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Eastern Naval Command. Damage from the cyclone, which cost the Indian Navy more than US$300 million, demonstrates the threat posed by increasingly intense and frequent storms and sea-level rise to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs naval assets on its eastern coast.

Looking forward, the military will need to adjust its equipment and its strategies to cope with the impacts of environmental changes. For example, to sustain their operational capabilities, temperature-controlled equipment (including tanks, submarines and aircraft), it will have to adapt to changing climatic conditions, as well as meet the requirements of Ozone Depleting Substances regulations.

Environmental change could physically alter the battlefield

Environmental change could physically alter the battlefield, forcing IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs armed forces to change their existing game plans. Indian troops are deployed in some of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs most ecologically and politically sensitive zones, such as its mountainous border with Pakistan, where enemy forces could exploit an environmental disaster to strike critical nodes and vulnerabilities. For example, changes in Himalayan glaciers could cause the water levels in downstream rivers to fluctuate drastically, limiting the militaryÃ¢ÂÂs range and endangering water supplies for military installations.

Climate change may also spur people in vulnerable countries to cross borders in search of safer ground. India has fenced part of its border with Bangladesh to prevent illegal immigration, and while most of these migrants are not yet pushed by climatic changes, some experts imagine an alarming scenario where climate change-induced migration lead the two countries to wage war with each other. Even in the absence of climate migration, Indian armed forces have to take environmental factors into consideration while patrolling and safeguarding the border.

The Indian MilitaryÃ¢ÂÂs Environmental Efforts

Across the country, the Indian military is taking some steps to improve its sustainability and efficiency. For example, it is helping increase the countryÃ¢ÂÂs renewable energy generation capacity by allowing defense lands to host solar energy installations. Similarly, the Indian Navy recently launched its first warship running entirely on biofuel at the 2016 International Fleet Review and it is in the process of upgrading its blue-water capabilities to achieve a zero carbon footprint. Karwar Ã¢ÂÂ which is not only IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs largest naval base, but also the largest naval base east of the Suez Canal Ã¢ÂÂ has been designed to be a Ã¢ÂÂSmart Green Naval BaseÃ¢ÂÂ with highly efficient energy, water, and wastewater management systems.

Another priority area for the Indian armed forces is military-to-military cooperation around humanitarian assistance and disaster response. The military has been working with the United States, Japan and other countries to conduct joint exercises in the region. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Indian armed forces have been at the forefront of regional disaster response, offering assistance to the countryÃ¢ÂÂs immediate neighbors and beyond, most notably the response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

The Coldest WarÃ¢ÂÂAnd the Biggest Battle

On the worldÃ¢ÂÂs highest battleground, Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off on the rapidly melting Siachen glacier, which has receded by nearly 800 meters during the last 20 years. Some experts assert that the heavy military presence in the region has helped to accelerate the melting and polluted the Indus River that flows through both countries. To mitigate their impact on the glacier, the Indian Army launched the Clean Siachen-Green Siachen Campaign to plant trees on the Indian side of the border. However, to maintain its operations in the region, and staunch the criticism they face, the military must also deal with the human waste that has polluted the riverÃ¢ÂÂand prepare for the long-term impacts of climate change on this ongoing conflict.

Until now, the Indian military has taken only fragmented and sporadic steps to address environmental security risks. But going forward, it should align its efforts with the countryÃ¢ÂÂs environmental objectives, especially the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs National Mission for a Green India. Not only should the armed forces adhere to the norms of environmental accountability, by taking a more holistic and institutionalized approach, they could also deploy their resources to help achieve long-term national security objectives that are imperilled by environmental degradation.","Indian Military Recognizes Environment as Ã¢ÂÂCriticalÃ¢ÂÂ Security Issue, But Response Is Still Fragmented"

""I've read about the decision to relocate the Rancho Wall. My entire cast and crew and I have some wonderful memories of that place. Honestly, if the constant stream of tourists is hampering the kids' education, distracting them and creating problems, then I feel it is the right call. At the end of the day, they were the ones who created and gave that wall its name, so I am sure it must be very close to them as well,"" he said.
The Aamir Khan-starrer created a lot of buzz and received appreciation from the audience as well as the critics. It was one of the highest grosser of all times.
The Rancho wall, which featured in the film, created such an uproar amongst the people that the school in Leh where the film was shot had dedicated an entire wall to Aamir Khan's character, making the Rancho wall a famous tourist point.
However, due to the constant hustle of visitors, students in the school are not able to focus on their studies and the management has decided to relocate the wall.
The school's principal, Stanzin Kunzang, in a recent interaction with ANI, said: ""Sometimes, it becomes difficult for us to handle the tourists here. At times, we used to have 800 people at a time. Besides visiting the wall, tourists enter the hostel and litter the corridor. Sometimes, they even use students' toilet creating an unpleasant situation.""
Earlier, there were reports that the school was planning to demolish the wall in order to ban the tourists. However, the school management denied the reports and said they are only relocating the wall. (ANI)",Rajkumar Hirani opens up about relocation of Rancho wall

The commissioning of the Gurupriya bridge last week by HonÃ¢ÂÂble Chief Minister is not just an infrastructure related event but an important milestone in the path of progress underlining the political will of the state to address the root cause of poverty and alienation. The bridge literally and figuratively paves the way for mainstreaming tribals of the 150 odd villages who were condemned to live hopelessly in the shadows of Naxal menace. It was the same area which had seen the gruesome gunning down of 38 greyhounds by Naxals in 2008. Today, the decks have been cleared for a much easier outreach by the Government and its welfare schemes to reach to the people giving them an opportunity to be a part of the development narrative.

At the same time it begs a bigger question. How can this development process become sustainable in the long term, especially in Western Odisha which is blessed by natural resources but plagued by the evils of the infamous Ã¢ÂÂRed corridorÃ¢ÂÂ?

The state Government, over the last decade, has been making steady progress in its outreach to the tribals in these far flung areas. Better farming practices, marketing of agro products, education, skill development, student scholarships as well the housing schemes both by the Centre and bolstered by the Biju Awas Yojana have opened new avenues for the marginalized sections of the society. But for this development to be sustainable in the long term there needs to be massive employment push both in the agrarian and the industrial sectors of the economy. This is precisely where Bauxite can play a pivotal role.

It is well known that the East coast bauxite, which literally runs through the red corridor, has the potential of making Odisha the Aluminium capital of the world. Odisha is home to 70% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs high quality bauxite reserve. If it is seen in the context of the fact that India boasts of having the 5th largest reserve of this crucial raw material, the potential is too obvious to ignore. Odisha is also blessed with good quality coal reserves. This unique configuration of availability of both bauxite and coal in close proximity is a phenomena unique to Odisha in the entire world. It is this geological uniqueness that makes Odisha a hot spot destination for Aluminium producers of the world. Once bauxite and coal are mined in adequate quantities the entire area will witness an economic boom heralding prosperity and more importantly peace.

Mining too is gradually coming out of a reputational crisis. The recently amended Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act has made the entire process of granting of mining rights a very transparent process. Auctioning is the way forward and very soon the decks will be cleared for it. Apart from the regulatory process it is technology that is making a crucial difference to mining. Modern technology is making the entire mining process less invasive and more environment friendly. Bauxite mining, especially, is a very eco-friendly process and NALCOÃ¢ÂÂs mines have proved it that post mining the area actually becomes much greener and even fertile..

Recently Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC), the Gold category State PSU has started mining in Kodingamali. Even in a nascent stage more than 2500 direct and indirect jobs have been generated and symbols of modern development like solar powered lights, tube wells, better roads and better culverts have started sprouting strengthening the faith of the local people in the development narrative.

In the run up to the elections the question which will be posed by the electorate is the issue of jobs for the youth. The Ã¢ÂÂMake in OdishaÃ¢ÂÂ campaign will also gather steam and as a consequence will attract a much closer scrutiny on its promises and its fulfilment ratio. Hopefully, Odisha will have an answer which would be much better than the rest. And the only way to achieve it is to create more industries, more jobs and a more inclusive and sustainable development.

NEW DELHI: An Indian cabinet minister accused a party colleague on Sunday of ordering the Ã¢ÂÂghastly murderÃ¢ÂÂ of a tiger and vowed legal action after the man-eating animal was shot in the countryÃ¢ÂÂs west.
The big cat blamed for killing more than a dozen people was shot dead Friday night after a months-long search, capping one of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs most high-profile tiger hunts in decades.
But the shooting in the forests of Maharashtra state sparked immediate controversy and allegations the kill was unethical and illegal.
Maneka Gandhi, a staunch animal activist and part of Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢ÂÂs cabinet, accused the state forest minister of hiring a Ã¢ÂÂtrigger-happy shooterÃ¢ÂÂ to slay the tiger.
Ã¢ÂÂIt is nothing but a straight case of crimeÃ¢ÂÂ, said Gandhi, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), describing the shooting as a Ã¢ÂÂghastly murderÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂI am definitely going to take up this case of utter lack of empathy for animals as a test case. Legally, criminally as well as politically,Ã¢ÂÂ she posted on Twitter.
Man-eating tiger shot dead in India after massive hunt
She accused the stateÃ¢ÂÂs forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar Ã¢ÂÂ also from the BJP Ã¢ÂÂ of ignoring appeals to call off the hunt for the tiger known officially as T1 and popularly as Avni.
The Supreme Court had issued a hunting order for T1 in September, ruling that she could be killed if tranquilisers failed.
Several appeals were made against the death sentence.
Forestry officials acknowledged to Indian media that no vet was present during the hunt, as required by the Supreme Court order.
The Indian branch of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said the tiger slaughter was about Ã¢ÂÂsatisfying a hunterÃ¢ÂÂs lust for bloodÃ¢ÂÂ.
The big cat was blamed for 13 deaths since June 2016 but animal activists said she was trying to protect her young.
A team of more than 150 people had spent months searching for T1, using a paraglider and dozens of infrared cameras while sharpshooters had ridden on the backs of elephants.
T1 was shot by Asghar Ali Khan, son of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs most famous hunter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, who was meant to be leading the hunt but was not present Friday night.
India man-eating tiger dies after being electrocuted
The senior Khan defended his sonÃ¢ÂÂs actions as Ã¢ÂÂa reflex action of self-defenceÃ¢ÂÂ as the tiger turned on the hunting party after being struck by a tranquiliser dart.
India has launched a major campaign to boost tiger numbers. At the last tiger census in 2014 the number had risen to more than 2,200 from a low of less than 1,500.
But urban spread as the population of 1.25 billion grows has increasingly eaten into the territory of wild animals.

Tens of thousands of farmers from across India took to streets of the capital on Friday, demanding relief from debt, higher prices for their produce and a special session of parliament dedicated to their needs.
Friday's rally in New Delhi may be the biggest demonstration so far of frustration with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. The farmers want Modi to intervene and forgive some of their government loans.
""Down with Modi!"" thousands chanted.
India's agriculture sector employs nearly half of India's 1.3 billion people, but it makes up only about 15 percent of the country's economy. Low food prices have depressed rural incomes and farmers are frustrated. They remain a huge voting bloc, and elections are coming in early 2019.
The government of India provides some crop subsidies, but farmers say it's not enough.
In trains and tractors, as many as 100,000 farmers, according to Indian media estimates, arrived in the capital Thursday night. Around 3,500 extra security personnel are deployed along the march route, which winds through the city center. Police held back traffic as protesting farmers filled six-lane thoroughfares.

The crowd is made up of more than 200 farmer groups created after police shot to death six farmers at a similar protest in 2017, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
In New Delhi on Friday, students and doctors set up medical checkpoints along the route, distributing food and water. One of the trending hashtags on Twitter is #MarchWithFarmers. There's also a website for participants, called Dilli Chalo, or ""Let's go to Delhi.""
Modi has promised to support farmers, and insists they get a fair deal under his BJP rule. He has also accused opposition parties of using the farmers' plight for political gain.
But in the lead-up to next year's elections, Modi has been more vocal about causes dear to his nationalist base, such as protecting Hindu holy sites, including one at the city of Ayodhya that has been the focus of tensions between Hindus and Muslims for decades. In 1992, Hindu extremists demolished a 16th-century mosque there, sparking riots that left thousands of people, mostly Muslims, dead.
Modi has vowed to build a Hindu temple on the site.
On Thursday night, some farmers chanted ""Ayodhya nahi, karz Maafi!"" Ã¢ÂÂ which in Hindi means ""Not Ayodhya, we want loan waivers.""

Some protesters carried skulls and bones they said were from farmers who had killed themselves in desperation. A handful of farmers stripped naked and laid down in front of TV cameras, to draw attention to their cause.
For India's farmers, debt can be deadly. Since 2013, some 12,000 farmers have killed themselves each year, according to a report submitted to India's Supreme Court last year.
""I hope the government helps me, so I can help my son to grow up,"" says Surya Raga, a cotton farmer who traveled to Delhi from the southern Indian state of Telangana.
Raga was marching with a photograph of her deceased husband. In 2014, he took his own life after being unable to pay back a government loan of about $4,300 dollars. With her husband dead, and Raga having taken over his farming duties, she wants the loan forgiven. She was marching with a group of women farmers who've all lost family members to suicide sparked by farming debt.
India's government has pledged debt relief in cases of drought or natural disaster. But farmers say it's been slow to arrive.
""We are suffering a lot. There is no drinking water even 1,000 feet under the ground,"" says Galli Venkatrao Reddy, a chili pepper farmer from the state of Andhra Pradesh whose crops have been been hit by drought. ""We want the government to immediately send us some relief.""
Reddy believes he is entitled to a drought relief package from his state government, but he says it hasn't come. He traveled more than 1,200 miles to Delhi, with his wife and eleven other farmers from his region.
Various politicians waded into the farmers' crowd, pledging to help them. The leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, was expected to be at the rally later Friday. Modi was unable to attend, because he is in Argentina for the G20 summit.
The mass rally on Friday marks the second time farmers have marched on the capital in recent weeks. The last time, on Oct. 2, they were met by police with water cannons and tear gas. Dozens of farmers were injured in clashes.
Indian farmers' complaints are longstanding. The biggest government effort to help them came in 2004, with a national commission that issued five reports on how to help Indians working in agriculture.
But advocates for farmers say the recommendations have never been addressed.
""In 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to have a discussion on those reports,"" says P. Sainath, founder of the People's Archive of Rural India, which publishes reports about farmers and supports their efforts to organize. ""But when it comes to the interests of corporations, they'll hold a special session of parliament at midnight.""","Farmers Throng India's Capital, Demanding Higher Crop Prices, Debt Relief"

SURAT: Ã¢ÂÂIn Indian culture , world is a big family and all the Asian countries are also united by this feeling of oneness,Ã¢ÂÂ Gujarat governor O P Kohli said here after inaugurating the two-day Asian Philosophical Conference in Kamrej on Wednesday.Kohli said that the Indian way of human welfare would show the way to other countries in creating a better world and human welfare.Ã¢ÂÂMy way is the best way,Ã¢ÂÂ this thought process of individual countries leads to major conflict. But the Indian and Asian way of thinking in unison and oneness would provide solutions to the global problems,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.Ã¢ÂÂThe fight among eastern and western part of the world is the differences in thought process. East visualizes and looks at it in a holistic angle and wants something that is better for the whole mankind, whereas West has a stubborn and narrow thinking .We can only unite east and west by thinking of unity. The only instrument to bridge the gap is following Indian culture that believes in taking everyone along,Ã¢ÂÂ Kohli said.The governor also expressed concern over environment degradation and said humans are harming the nature for their physical needs and better facilities to live. Ã¢ÂÂThis would create an imbalance and mankind will have to pay dearly for this folly,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.Cultural representative of Iran Dr Ali Dehgahi , in his address as a chief guest, said Asia is the origin of oldest human civilization, religion, philosophy and development.

261,1816,positive,"Like Ã¢ÂÂsemi-finalÃ¢ÂÂ election, the term Ã¢ÂÂwake-up callÃ¢ÂÂ is much overused in Indian political discourse. Last Tuesday, as the painfully slow counting process yielded the outcome of the five assembly elections and left the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party shell-shocked, the more cautious among analysts were inclined to limit the fallout of the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs setback and the CongressÃ¢ÂÂ spectacular recovery. It was, they felt, a jolt to the Narendra Modi government but not necessarily one that would definitely ensure a change of government at the Centre in May 2019. In short, it was the proverbial wake-up call.
The more optimistic in the BJP saw a silver lining in the unexpected defeats. Another round of victories, they rationalised, would have infected the party with insufferable arrogance and complacency in the few months before the general election got under way. They pointed to the smugness that had gripped the organisation after the three victories in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in December 2003, an over-confidence that propelled the leadership to advance the date of the general election by six months. The expectation of inevitable victory against a shambolic Opposition led to major tactical miscalculations, indifferent campaigning and even a lower turnout of the committed voters in 2004 and cost Atal Bihari Vajpayee a second term. The belief is that after TuesdayÃ¢ÂÂs defeats, the party leadership will be more circumspect, more sensitive to stirrings on the ground and leave nothing to chance.
To some extent, the wake-up call theory is not pure wishful thinking. Ever since the mahagathbandhan of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United) and Congress trounced the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the Bihar assembly election of 2015, the BJP has become more alert to the possibility that banking on the vagaries of the first-past-the-post system was insufficient. The party had to expand its support base to survive the likely unity of all forces that perceived ModiÃ¢ÂÂs rise as a threat to their very existence. The percolation of the BJP down the social ladder was in evidence during the Uttar Pradesh election in early-2017 and yielded handsome returns. Even in the recently-concluded assembly election, the BJP did make a concerted bid to reach voters outside the saffron fold. The outreach was based on bringing together beneficiaries of state and Central government welfare schemes.
Why did this approach falter?
It is now sufficiently clear that the BJP seriously underestimated the political consequences of the fall in agricultural incomes. It is not that the problem bypassed the attention of the decision makers. The state governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were quite prompt in raising the minimum support price for agricultural produce. However, the increase in Chhattisgarh was perceived to be grossly inadequate and the payment of differential in Madhya Pradesh could not include all the produce farmers had to sell. In such a situation, the unrelenting focus of the Congress president, Rahul Gandhi, on the diminishing real income of farmers had a marked impact.
The most dramatic effect was felt in Chhattisgarh. GandhiÃ¢ÂÂs announcement at a campaign rally in the state shortly before the second phase of polling of a hike in the MSP to Rs 2,500 per quintal and a complete loan waiver within 10 days of the Congress forming the state government had an electrifying effect. At one stroke it nullified the appeal of all the welfare schemes of the Raman Singh government and led to the decimation of the BJP in the rural areas. The BJP vote fell dramatically from 41.04 per cent in 2013 to 32.9 per cent.
The rural swing in Chhattisgarh had a knock-on effect in the urban clusters. The demonetisation of November 2016 and the subsequent introduction of the goods and services tax had unsettled the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs core support base of small traders, accustomed to operating in a twilight zone between the formal and informal economy. The resentment had been in evidence during the UP and Gujarat assembly elections but the party had somehow managed the disquiet. In Chhattisgarh, however, the Congress managed to tap the anger and cream off enough of the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs core vote to make a visible difference. Survey reports from Rajasthan also suggest that the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs solid vote among the upper castes was affected, also presumably by the GST.
It was significant that Ã¢ÂÂsmall shopkeepersÃ¢ÂÂ were among the people Rahul Gandhi thanked profusely at his press conference in Delhi on Tuesday evening after the declaration of results.
That there would be a political price to pay for GST was known by the BJP top brass since its introduction in 2017. However, after Amit Shah inveigled the party out of a difficult situation in places such as Surat during the assembly elections, there was a belief that the crisis had been averted. It obviously hadnÃ¢ÂÂt. The question is: was this a one time protest vote by disaffected traders who will now return to the parent fold for the general election?
My feeling is that the BJP will have to travel the extra mile to address the grievances of both farmers and traders. As of now, the Modi government has shied away from populist sops such as loan waivers and tried to address the question of farm incomes with a long-term, systemic approach. However, the instant appeal of Rahul GandhiÃ¢ÂÂs fiscally imprudent but politically rewarding sops has put inordinate pressure on the Modi government to do something similar. So far the prime minister Ã¢ÂÂ always impatient with patchwork solutions that skirt the roots of the problem Ã¢ÂÂ has resisted pressures. But with the CongressÃ¢ÂÂs populism striking a responsive chord, he may have to compromise. Martyrdom for the sake of principles is never popular in democratic politics.
The issue is not merely centred on the quality of governance. Fiscal responsibility is undoubtedly a lofty ideal that has earned the Modi government praise from investors and other custodians of global capital. Unfortunately, it is not a very popular approach and very difficult to sell politically Ã¢ÂÂ and not merely in India. Being tough and steadfast has its own attractions but there is also a real danger that the tough-guy image may get to be equated with a lack of caring and compassion. Modi could perhaps do with some fine-tuning of his image.
The latest round of assembly elections have undermined the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs self-confidence, but only partially. The belief that ModiÃ¢ÂÂs personal appeal is still firmly intact continues to drive the BJP, just as it rallies his opponents to cling together for self-preservation. There is, for example, a general consensus that had it not been for ModiÃ¢ÂÂs spirited rallies, the outcome in Rajasthan would have been far worse for the BJP. Modi couldnÃ¢ÂÂt prevent a defeat but he warded off a rout. In all the three states, the BJP will live to fight hard and reclaim lost ground in 2019.
Yet, these election results have shown that in invoking agricultural distress and limited opportunities for organised employment, Rahul Gandhi has managed an unexpected response. Some would argue that the experience has even turned an entitled dynast into a real political leader, capable of exercising informed decisions. Unless Modi responds, as people expect him, he may end up nullifying the possibility of the 2019 general election being fought as a quasi-presidential contest. If, instead of stability and leadership, local grievances occupy centre-stage, the anti-BJP forces will have the upper hand. In that case, the 2014 promise of achchhe din may come to haunt the BJP next year.",The BJP will have to go the extra mile to address the grievances of farmers and traders

Mumbai: With multiple incidents highlighting the escalating man-animal conflict across India coming to light in recent weeks, animal rights activists are up in arms over the death of a male leopard which was found dead in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district on Sunday evening. Going by reports, the big cat attacked as many as four people in Chiplun on Tuesday before locals discovered its carcass next to a river near Gane and Waloti villages.
Officials with the forest department said that the leopard may have succumbed to injuries incurred earlier in the week when it attacked four people at a spot between Khadpoli and Gane villages in the area. In fact, one of the locals was even rushed to a civil hospital following the attack on him. Meanwhile, the other three civillians managed to escape the majestic creature with minor injuries.

As a result of the attack, a team of rangers from the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) was rushed to the Ratnagiri district which falls under the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). However, they failed to locate the leopard before locals discovered its carcass from the area. A senior member of an animal welfare group told media personnel that the big cat's body was found 24 to 36 hours after it breathed last which would explain why it had started decomposing. Divisional forest officer, Ratnagiri, VK Surve said that the leonine creature's body will be subjected to a post-mortem following which it will be burnt.
In fact, a recent report by the Delhi-based Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) cites that in 2018, India recorded its highest leopard mortality in the last four years. While almost 34 per cent of the big cats were poached for purposes of trafficking, the remaining 74 per cent died either due to train or road accidents. Data from previous years asserts that 460 leopards died this past year as compared to 431 in 2017, 440 in 2016, 399 in 2015 and 331 in 2014.

264,1834,positive,"Changes to a law in Gujarat state will allow authorities to develop land that was intended for distribution to impoverished farmers, said campaigners who plan to challenge the move in court.
President, Ram Nath Kovind, last week approved amendments to the state's agricultural land ceiling act, which caps the amount of land held by an individual.
Excess farmland surrendered to the state in the 1960s, when the law was enacted across the country, was meant to be distributed to poor farmers and landless villagers. The amendment allows the state to change the use of the land.
""The state assembly had unanimously passed amendments to the bill, but it was pending with the (central government) for over two years. Now it has been approved,"" a home ministry spokesman told reporters.
State officials have said some of the surplus land is not viable for farming, and that some of the land will be used to build schools and for other public purposes.
Campaigners say officials delayed handing over property to the landless, and that the amended law makes it easier for the state to use the land to build highways and industrial zones.
""The main purpose of the Land Ceiling Act was to give land to the landless poor. It is very wrong to amend the law to use that land for other purposes,"" said Jayesh Patel, an activist with Gujarat Khedut Samaj, a farmers' rights group.
""We are filing a petition in the state high court to challenge the state's action,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation over the phone on Thursday.
About 60 percent of India's population of 1.3 billion people depends on agriculture for its livelihood. More than half the country's lower-caste population is landless, official data show.
All Indian states adopted laws by 1962 that limited the amount of land an individual or family could own. Surplus land was meant to be redistributed amongst the poor for farming.
But only about 5 million acres (2 million hectares) have been redistributed to approximately six million poor farmers, according to government think tank Niti Aayog.
Even when land is redistributed on paper, there is often a delay in handing it over, campaigners say.
Protests flared in Gujarat earlier this year after the suicide of an activist over the delay in granting land to a Dalit couple.
The state's move may trigger more such protests, Patel said.
""We need the state to redistribute land, not amend the law to make it easier to use the land for other purposes when there are so many still waiting for land,"" he said.",Gujarat state amends law to give land to industry instead of the poor

Residents of 1.65 lakh-sqm plot saycovered up their existence to let Wadia-run trust take over the plot.Still trying to save face after losing a 13,000-sqm open land in Jogeshwari, the BMC has now been accused of conniving with a private trust to allow it to take over a plot more than 12 times bigger in Dindoshi.Ã¢ÂÂ an association of around 5,000 residents representing close to 25,000 people who claim to be living in a 1.65 lakh-sqmin Dindoshi, estimated to be worth thousands of crores Ã¢ÂÂ has filed a fresh petition in the Bombay High Court alleging collusion between the BMC and FE Dinshaw Trust, headed by industrialist Nusli Wadia.Referring to an order passed by the HC in May, the petition said the existence of so many families on the land was deliberately not brought to the courtÃ¢ÂÂs notice in earlier proceedings, which resulted in the HC directing the BMC to hand over Ã¢ÂÂvacant possessionÃ¢ÂÂ of the land to the trust. It claimed that the land is reserved for Ã¢ÂÂhousing for the dishousedÃ¢ÂÂ and that those displaced between 1986 and 1991 currently live there.The petition cited numerous correspondences between them and the trust as well as BMC, and between the trust and the BMC as well as theto assert that their existence was never in dispute, and yet, the court wasnÃ¢ÂÂt informed of it.It said had proof of their residence on the land as well as correspondences among all stakeholders been furnished before it, the court would have directed the BMC and the state government Ã¢ÂÂto protect the interest of petitionersÃ¢ÂÂ membersÃ¢ÂÂ.An earlier litigation was filed by the trust in 2014 against the state government and the BMC. It said that although the civic body had been in possession of the land since 1974, it had failed to carry out the acquisition process even after 10 years of the plot being reserved in 1993. The trust had served a purchase notice to the BMC in 2011 under the, asking it to either purchase the land within a year or to de-reserve it. But neither the BMC nor the state formally completed the acquisition process.On May 3 this year, the HC passed an order in the trustÃ¢ÂÂs favour, asking the authorities to hand over the land to the trust within a year. The court, however, allowed the state to initiate proceedings for land acquisition under the Ã¢ÂÂlaw of compulsory acquisitionÃ¢ÂÂ within the year.Aspokesperson for the Wadia group refused to comment, saying the case was sub judice.Sources, however, suggested that the only affidavit filed by an executive engineer of the BMC in the previous litigation had a paragraph mentioning that the land had been put to use for housing displaced people. Ã¢ÂÂThat the reservation is developed for its intended purpose by developing and maintaining the infrastructure utility such as storm water drains, sewers, water connection, roads, street light etc,Ã¢ÂÂ said the affidavit, which was filed in March this year.The HC judgment does not mention whether either the BMC or the trust had informed it of this. It only notes that the BMC had told the court of having developed the land by constructing roads and laying galvanised iron pipelines.The court is likely to hear the fresh petition later this month.",Plea: Dindoshi land lost due to BMC collusion

The Meghalaya Human Rights Commission (MHRC) has filed a Suo Motu case against the state government for compensation for the trapped miners inside the illegal mine.
A government official, who is overseeing the rescue operations at the Lumthari mining site, about 130 km from here, said the trapped miners are feared dead as the water from nearby Lytein stream is gushing into the pit.
""Only a miracle can save these miners. None of us knows where these miners are. They need oxygen and food to survive,"" the official told IANS on condition of anonymity.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has used sonar system and underwater camera to detect the trapped miners. However, the system failed to locate any of those trapped in the main well due to poor visibility.
Experts from Coal India Limited, geologists have visited the site.
Meghalaya Police arrested Jrin alias Krip Chulet, the owner of the coal mine from Narwan village. Police said that a hunt is on to arrest the other members of the illegal mining nexus.
The accident inside the coal pit on December 13 morning was of significance, especially after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered an interim ban on ""rat-hole"" coal mining in the state from April 17, 2014.
""The State Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the Chief Secretary Y. Tsering to conduct an inquiry into the entire matter and submit a detailed report before the State Commission within 30 days,"" MHRC Secretary Aldous Mawlong said.
The State Commission is of the firm opinion to grant interim relief to the next of kin of those unfortunate miners, Mawlong said.
""We are putting all efforts to evacuate the trapped miners. We are using all available technology,"" Assistant Commandant NDRF, Santosh Kumar Singh, told IANS.
More than 100 rescuers including 72 members from the NDRF, 23 from State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and five members of the Fire and Emergency Service were deployed at the site.
""We suspect the miners are trapped inside the lateral mining chambers of coal pit. It is difficult to know as to how many chambers are there because of poor visibility,"" Singh said.
Police has registered a case against the mine owner under several sections of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, and Section 21(1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act.
Chief Minister Conrad Sangma had promised that ""appropriate action will be taken at appropriate time against the people who are involved in the illegal mining and this is not acceptable to us"".
Coal mine accidents are common in the mountainous state because of unscientific mining procedure, commonly known as ""rat hole mining"".

LUCKNOW: Taking a leaf out of Gujarat model of land acquisition, the UP government is mulling the idea of 'land pooling' from individual land holders to execute its various ambitious housing and other developmental projects.The novel concept envisages government developing an individual land holding for higher evaluation and subsequently taking over part of it for its own projects. The remaining land is then returned to the owners who can partner with real estate developers to build apartments and residential properties.According to sources in the UP housing and urban planning department, the land required by the authority shall vest in the authority, free from all encumbrances. The authority will hand over possession of the final plots to the owners to whom they are allotted in the land pooling scheme. A permanent tribunal for this scheme is also proposed to be constituted, sources said.""The problem of land shortage is posing a serious challenge for the projects. This scheme can address the problem to a significant extent,"" director, Awas Bandhu, SK Srivastava told TOI, while confirming that the state government was working on the land pooling policy.UP government has been facing acute shortage of land bank to carry out many of its projects. Records available with the department of housing and urban planning department show that 34 development authorities and Uttar Pradesh Housing Board (UPHB) together have only 4,700 hectares of land with them. Of this, around 2,200 hectares, that is nearly half of the total, is with UPHB Records also show that at least 10 districts, including PM's constituency Varanasi, does not have an inch of land available for any housing or other development project.The scheme, UP government sources said, has been applied in Gujarat where individuals would share their unutilized - often barren - land with the state government for development and subsequent higher evaluation. Once developed, the government takes over around 60-75% of the land for its own projects, leaving 25-40% with the individual.

So itÃ¢ÂÂs remarkable that India Ã¢ÂÂ itself a vocal critic of belt-and-road Ã¢ÂÂ allowed a local financier to do something similar on home turf, with little accountability or supervision.

A perennial paucity of budgetary resources has forced taxpayers to outsource infrastructure Ã¢ÂÂ not to the Chinese, but to local public-private partnerships led by IL&FS. However, in many instances, only the returns became private. Risks remained with the public.

Those risks have now come back to bite. IL&FS and its associates have $12.5 billion in debt, and not enough liquidity. For instance, IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. has only $27 million at hand, and about $500 million of repayment obligations over the next six months, sparking a debt-repayment crisis that threatens to engulf Indian banks and mutual funds to insurance and pension funds. Chairman Ravi Parthasarathy, paid $3.65 million last fiscal year, left abruptly in July after being with the company since its inception.

When I first encountered it, the five-year-old IL&FS was barely getting started with what would become its unique model: a financier that also conceived, executed and owned large projects. It offered to do all those things in 1992, when IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs capital city of New Delhi and its eastern suburb of Noida agreed to build a connecting expressway across the river Yamuna. The IL&FS-controlled Noida Toll Bridge Co. opened a gleaming eight-lane motorway nine years later.

Driving on it was divine, but it soon became apparent shareholders were getting a risk-free ride at commutersÃ¢ÂÂ expense, with the project guaranteeing 20 percent returns to equity investors including IL&FS. When the Delhi and Noida governments gave the land, they had expected the expressway to be returned to them in 30 years. In 2008, though, it looked like the asset was going to be in private hands for at least 70 years. In 2016, a court called out the daylight robbery and ordered the toll plazas to be dismantled. Stock of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs first publicly traded toll road shot up above 70 rupees in 2007; it changes hands for less than 9 rupees now.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs unclear whether IL&FS learned anything from that fiasco. Gift City, Indian Prime Minister Narendra ModiÃ¢ÂÂs pet project to set up an international finance center in his home state of Gujarat, saw the state government lease land at throwaway prices to an IL&FS-controlled company. A former head of Gift City boardÃ¢ÂÂs audit committee had to leave after he made noises about the one-sided contract, and complained about the engineering and architectural services vendor appointed by IL&FS not fulfilling its obligations or returning money paid.

I could go on. Foreign investors, as well as locals such as Life Insurance Corp. of India, and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., joined IL&FS as equity partners in a socially worthwhile and economically necessary water treatment plant in Tirupur, a textile town in Tamil Nadu. But now the investors say theyÃ¢ÂÂve been diluted against their knowledge because IL&FS Ã¢ÂÂ also a lender Ã¢ÂÂ wants to maximize value for itself. A challenge by one investor alleging oppression by IL&FS and the Tamil Nadu government has reached IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Supreme Court.

The unlisted IL&FS parent is beyond stock market scrutiny. And while it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt fall within the regulatory regime for deposit-taking institutions, itÃ¢ÂÂs categorized as systemically important. Yet thereÃ¢ÂÂs never been any real oversight of it; an infrastructure-financier thatÃ¢ÂÂs also an operator with 169 subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is too complex for any watchdog or credit-rating firm.

Its majority owners are state-owned, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs given IL&FS the aura of a quasi-sovereign. Life Insurance Corp. is IL&FSÃ¢ÂÂs biggest shareholder, yet its officials privately rue the fact that they were diluted in Tirupur to the point they left the operating companyÃ¢ÂÂs board. The same state-run insurer will probably have to rescue it now. On Saturday, IL&FS changed its chairman once again.

Were IL&FS a Chinese company in a developing country, there would be an uproar by now about exploitative contracts, and the trail of waste left in their wake. But this is an Indian company in India, playing on the nationÃ¢ÂÂs desperation for decent infrastructure. As a young intern in Delhi 25 years ago, when I yearned for a quick passage across the river, I had no idea the bridge to a better life would one day extract such a heavy toll.

MUMBAI: Following farmer Dharma PatilÃ¢ÂÂs death, the NCP accused tourism minister Jaykumar Rawal of being a Ã¢ÂÂland sharkÃ¢ÂÂ and demanded his immediate dismissal.Ã¢ÂÂWe demand that CM Devendra Fadnavis should sack him and register an offence of murder against Rawal as well as energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule ,Ã¢ÂÂ said NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik.Malik said according to the Maharashtra land revenue code, once a land acquisition notification is issued, one cannot purchase plots in that area. Ã¢ÂÂRawal bought 1.76 hectares on April 20, 2012, for Rs 2.83 lakh much after the notification. We are surprised how the deal was registered,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.Malik further alleged that a high-level meeting was convened in BawankuleÃ¢ÂÂs chamber on January 22 to discuss PatilÃ¢ÂÂs demand and it was to be attended by Rawal and revenue minister Chandrakant Patil. He said the meeting was called off for reasons not known.Ã¢ÂÂAfter the land ceiling Act came into force, an individual can hold 20 to 21 hectares, but the Rawal family owns 323 hectares. In one instance, the family has got Rs 1 crore compensation for four hectares. We have lodged a complaint with the CM, SP and ACB. I am told that following CMÃ¢ÂÂs instructions, the probe was abandoned,Ã¢ÂÂ Malik said. After PatilÃ¢ÂÂs death, the CM has ordered a probe into the entire episode.Malik has also accused Rawal of having illegally acquired former President Pratibha Patil and her four brothersÃ¢ÂÂ 11 hectares land. Ã¢ÂÂPratibha Patil has approached the court for justice,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.Responding to the charges, Rawal said, Ã¢ÂÂAll charges against me are baseless and false. From official records, it will be clear that I have tried to get better compensation for farmers since 2009. In fact, I had raised the issue in the legislative assembly too. PatilÃ¢ÂÂs suicide is unfortunate. He was agitating for better compensation since 2009; the then government and then officials are responsible for his death. Stern action should be taken against these officials. Charges against me are politically motivated. I did purchase some land, but it was prior to the notification for the thermal power project. It was expected that farmers will receive compensation between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, but officials did not let that happen and that proposal was rejected.Meanwhile, state Congress president Ashok Chavan condemned the BJP-led government for ignoring farmers. Ã¢ÂÂIt clearly reflects the indifferent attitude of the government. A murder offence must be registered,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.Chavan added that it was unfortunate that though the CM was in Mumbai, he did not visit the farmer at JJ Hospital when he was critical. Ã¢ÂÂIt has come to light that Patil submitted several memorandums to Bawankule, but they were ignored,Ã¢ÂÂ Chavan said.","NCP blames Ã¢ÂÂland sharkÃ¢ÂÂ tourism minister, seeks his resignation"

275,1891,positive,"Sacred groves are often hailed as beacons of conservation, but itÃ¢ÂÂs the socio-cultural dynamics, not environment protection, that inform most of these spaces

Manu Moudgil

Mata Karni Devi Temple near Bikaner is famous for thousands of rats that scurry around, milling with devotees. Several hours of television programming have been dedicated to the rodents, regarded as reincarnations of the goddessÃ¢ÂÂs devotees. What has not gained much attention, however, is the 2,100 hectare scrub land near the temple. Called Oran or Devbani in local parlance, it is one of the several sacred groves spread over one lakh hectare of Rajasthan, which are protected by the people.

Orans are dedicated to one or more local deities and this ancient tradition of incorporating sacred with economic and ecological benefits played a vital role in sustaining the pastoral culture of the state.

Similar examples are spread throughout India with estimates suggesting up to 1.5 lakh sacred groves. These groves can either be around a temple like that near Bikaner or the forest where the village deity resides. For instance, Dongria Kondh tribe of Niyamgiri hills in Odisha, famous for resisting the bauxite mining project of Vedanta Resources in 2013, consider the hills the kingdom of their deity Niyam Raja. Though villagers depend on the natural resources including trees, grasses and water streams, it is need based. Smaller sacred groves can also be found around burial or cremation grounds.

The CPR Environmental Education Centre (CPREEC), a centre of excellence of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), has recorded thousands of sacred groves across the country. Himachal Pradesh tops the list with 5,000 sacred groves, which should not be a surprise as the region is known to have several deities. Kullu Valley alone has more than 500 deities, who converge along with their oracles at the week-long Kullu Dusshera celebrations and also Ã¢ÂÂpresideÃ¢ÂÂ over important issues like the Himalayan Ski Village project that was rejected by them in the year 2006. Himachal is followed by Maharashtra (2,837), Kerala (2,000) and Karnataka (1,531) in number of sacred groves.

With certain rules around extraction of resources, including ban on cutting of trees, these groves contribute significantly to wildlife protection, soil conservation, groundwater recharge, and as a good source of herbs, fruits and other economic resources to local people. No wonder, these forests qualify many parameters of conservation and sustainability and environmentalists promote this convergence of tradition with ecosystem as a counter to deforestation for developmental projects. Since faith connects people better than ecological discourse, these depictions have been relatively successful, Niyamgiri protest being the prime example.

Shifting shapes, fluid sanctity

The practices around sacred groves differ with location and may not always abide by the concept of unaltered, pristine state of forests as to the liking of conservationists. The contours tend to respond to the socio-cultural changes around them.

Ã¢ÂÂThe conditions around such sacred spaces are constantly being negotiated, depending on what ideas are dominant,Ã¢ÂÂ says Dr Nitin Rai, a Fellow with Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (Atree), who was part of a team that mapped culturally significant sites of Soliga adivasis in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve in southern Karnataka.

At Upli Sigri village in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, the flexibility with faith and conservation is quite evident. A habitation of around 200 tribal families, Upli Sigri has a rich teak wood forest spread over 60 hectare, but with increase in population and improved access to markets in Udaipur and Ahmedabad, there was illegal cutting of trees for commercial use. Many a time it led to confrontations with neighbouring villages.

The illegal felling came to a halt in 2012 when the residents of Upli Sigri held a special prayer at nearby temple of Kesariya ji, a local deity revered by all tribes of the region. Kesar (saffron) from the temple was then scattered in the forest area symbolising divine protection. Ã¢ÂÂIt is believed that if somebody cuts a tree after such a ceremony, he suffers an immediate loss,Ã¢ÂÂ says Arjun Lal, a villager. The protection, however, was only for five years after which the villagers decided to utilise the trees and fodder grass. This need-based sacredness doesnÃ¢ÂÂt fit into the modern, fixed concept of forest and wildlife protection.

Dr Rai is wary of the appropriation of the traditions of tribals for conservation. Ã¢ÂÂWe have to think carefully about conflating traditional practice with conservation goals as what local people value and desire may be very different from what is globally agreed on as important. They may have animistic traditions including totems related to tiger or wolf, but can we equate that to species protection?Ã¢ÂÂ he asks.

In her study, Of Paper Tigers and Invisible People on Sariska Tiger Sanctuary, researcher Radhika Johari also underscores this difference. She found that most of the sacred groves were in various stages of degradation and the deities also had a mobile representation through their mediums or oracles, mostly spiritual gurus, who moved from place to place.

Johari quotes examples of sacred sites which were abandoned at death of a guru and his spiritual lineage. Conversely, new ones came up with arrival of a guru in a village.

Many shades of conservation

At several places across India, the sacred groves are under stress. The small shrines are being converted into big temples with access roads. While ritualistic ceremonies were earlier restricted to once a year, some groves are now opening to visitors more frequently. In Kerala, the Mannarshala temple offers parking for at least 200 four-wheelers and thousands pray there every week. The once dense groves are reducing in size and becoming fragmented.

In a study published in 2014, researchers interviewed 59 members of the temple committees managing 53 sacred groves in Kodagu region of the Western Ghats. Only 14 per cent of those interviewed felt that reduction in area or conversion of dense forest into open, disturbed ones affected the cultural importance of a grove. Ã¢ÂÂThere appears to be a cultural change wherein societies place more value on popular gods and temple structures in sacred groves. On the other hand, local animistic beliefs and taboos that have historically been associated with the surrounding forests might have become less significant. Given that conservation is often only a byproduct and not a specified goal of sacred groves, changing cultural beliefs and practices could result in a loss of conservation potential in some cases,Ã¢ÂÂ says Anand M Osuri, who was part of the research team. He also cites growing demand for land as another reason for decrease in forest extent and quality in KodaguÃ¢ÂÂs sacred groves in recent decades.

Not everything is lost, however. The research team also found some very large groves, which were well protected. Ã¢ÂÂStrong and dedicated community management certainly plays a key part in protecting sacred groves. Many locals do appreciate ecological benefits of these groves, such as the cooling effect on local climate and the habitat they provide for crop-pollinating bees. The inaccessibility of some of the larger groves, which may be located in hilly areas and abutting wildlife reserves may further enhance their protection,Ã¢ÂÂ Osuri points out.

Several state governments have also come up with policies to protect sacred groves. With the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity calling for preservation of knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for biodiversity conservation, the sacred groves have gained global attention. But that is not enough to ensure good governance.

In 2015, Odisha identified 2,163 sacred groves in the state that need to be protected. But the list did not include mineral rich areas like Niyamgiri, underscoring the importance of economy over faith, at least in policy making.

Development and belief

The tribals who opposed the Vedanta mining project are often depicted as anti-development but thatÃ¢ÂÂs not correct. Due to exposure to nearby towns, Dongria Kondhs now demand electricity, health services and schools, found a study done by Kalpavriksh, a non-profit organisation. However, they want all this without destruction to their sacred landscape. They prefer to have solar energy over grid electricity because high-tension wires are hazardous and would mean big vehicles cutting roads into the forests to ferry electricity poles. For education, they prefer the children to gain knowledge, which would help them deal with the outside world but feel that government schools should use Kui Ã¢ÂÂ the local dialect Ã¢ÂÂ instead of Odia as a medium of instruction. While many elders are against roads because that would mean greater flow of outsiders, others feel if at all roads are to be built, they should be narrow enough to be accessed only by foot. If Niyamgiri villages are able to access basic services on their terms, they can set an example for several villages dithering between the desire for development and need to preserve their surroundings.",Faith in the forest

Rajgopal, fighting for the cause of landless and this law, will take the march of these landless people to Delhi from Morena. He said that all the work regarding making law has been done long back during the time of United Progressive government which just needs to be introduced in Parliament.

He claimed as per data that around 57 per cent rural household are landless. If the matter is taken up state wise Muslims in Bihar, Scheduled Caste and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and Scheduled Tribes in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Assam are more landless.
One being asked that what is the difficulty in getting this law made, Rajgopal says, ""Bureaucracy tells it being a state subject while they have been made to understand that this law could also be made in the line of Right To Education on which states can move ahead.

LUDHIANA: With 471 suicides reported from the city in 2017, including students and farmers, many more people are vulnerable. On the World Suicide Prevention Day, with the theme of working together to prevent suicide, the motto is Ã¢ÂÂKaroge gall, milega hallÃ¢ÂÂ of Ã¢ÂÂProject UtshahÃ¢ÂÂ.The first-of-its-kind Project Uthshah is run by the Department of Agricultural Journalism, Languages, and Culture at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), which is the lead centre in the suicide prevention project that falls under National Agricultural Science Fund of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi.The centre not just provides psychological first aid (PFA) to farmers, but also equips them to mentally handle stress, even at a time of agrarian crisis. Farmers in thousands thronged the stall named Ã¢ÂÂUthshahÃ¢ÂÂ during kisan melas all over Punjab, and as many as 980 farmers were found vulnerable so far.With 200 peer support volunteers all over Punjab, PAU is endeavouring to infuse the spirit of fighting back among farmers of Punjab in view of the current agrarian distress. In Ludhiana, 30 paraprofessionals have been trained as Peer Support Volunteers (PSVs) to provide first aid by counselling farmers in acute distress.Providing peer supportPeer support is a unique form of service based on mutual respect, sharing of experiences, and empathy. Effective self-management is often short-lived. Peers can provide leadership and serve as role models for sustained behavioural change.Farmers who attempted suicides are now PSVs. Independently working as paraprofessionals for farmers in distress , not only do they themselves come out of distress, but also become pillars of support for others. Sharing an experience, a 26-year-old farmer from a village in BhatindaÃ¢ÂÂs cotton belt attempted suicide by consuming pesticide in March 2017. He was saved with timely medical aid and counselled by the Uthshah team. That farmer is now a PSV, encouraging others to live a positive life and avoid depressing thoughts.Survey on suicidal thoughtsThe National Agri Science Fund project has just completed a baseline survey of about 1,100 distressed farming families across three states of India Ã¢ÂÂ Punjab, Maharashtra, and Telangana. Intervention by PSVs has already started. The baseline results would help researchers know the Cumulative Stress Index (CSI) and Psychological Resource Index (PRI) of farmers, as the survey collected information about depression, self-esteem, cognitive distortions, resilience, well-being, and suicidal ideation through standardized psychological tools.Dr Sarabjeet Singh Ã¢ÂÂ principal investigator of the project, National Agricultural Science Fund, and Professor of Journalism at PAU Ã¢ÂÂ said there was no system in place to help farmers maintain their emotional equilibrium in view of successive crop failures and rising debts. Even a little psychological first aid, if available, can benefit them. Apart from agricultural and remunerative pricing solutions, we need to take care of farmersÃ¢ÂÂ mental health too. They need to be trained to imbibe resilience and coping skills to battle with negative thoughts. Financial literacy and importance of savings should also be a part of farmer training. Ã¢ÂÂPsychological and mental health issues should not be swept under the carpet,Ã¢ÂÂ he reiterated.PAU is working towards capacity building of farming families through a positive transformation of rural youth. The trainings include empowerment of farmers in terms of battling negative thoughts, enabling them with coping skills, and financial literacy. They are exhorted to lead a life of simplicity away from drugs, cultivate positive thinking, and shun pomp and show in marriages and social functions.OFFICIALSPEAKDr Sarabjeet Singh, principal investigator of the project, National Agricultural Science Fund and Professor of Journalism, PAU:Ã¢ÂÂA person committing suicide experiences three things in common Ã¢ÂÂ a shattering feeling of defeat, inability to find an escape, and loss of hope. One perceives life as agonizing to an extent that only death can provide a reprieve. If society can offer help in any of these three feelings, one can be saved from committing suicide. Depression remains the cornerstone of all suicides, hence the university is now focusing on a strategy to destigmatize mental health issues in rural Punjab. It is exhorting farmers to talk as talking is healing and therapeutic. The PAU slogan Ã¢ÂÂKaroge Gall, Milega HallÃ¢ÂÂ (Talk and you will get a solution) is getting very popular with farmers.Ã¢ÂÂDr Baldev Singh Dhillon, vice-chancellor, Punjab Agricultural University:Ã¢ÂÂFocussing on making Punjab a suicide-free, aware, and alert society can prevent many suicides, just through small gestures. There is a need to proactively engage youth and farmers to open up and think about positive options in hours of crisis, instead of going in for deliberate self-harm. Literature has enough evidence to suggest that mere talking about suicide does not make one suicidal, rather it may reduce suicidal tendencies. As youth are daily exposed to suicide news covered by the media, we must proactively engage them to open up and think about positive options in hours of crisis, instead of going in for deliberate self-harm.THE UTHSHAH PROJECTPurpose: Seek a solution.Goal: Cessation of consciousness.Common stressor: Unmet psychological needs.Common stimulus: Unbearable psychological pain.Common emotion: Hopelessness, helplessness.Common cognitive state: Ambivalence.Common action: Aggression.SUICIDE WARNING SIGNS* Feeling hopeless, finding no reason to live, being a burden on others.* Feeling trapped, or in intolerable pain.* Sleeping too much or too less.* Isolating themselves, withdrawing from friends and family.* Aggression and extreme mood swings.* Expressing the wish to die or kill oneself.* Looking for ways to kill oneself online, arranging pills, ropes, pesticides etc.* Increasing use of alcohol, drugs.BOX 4PEER SUPPORT VOLUNTEERS6 core actions for Psychological First Aid: Helping others who are stressed and depressed* Listen, Listen, listen.* Ensure confidentiality.* Stabilize.* Assess needs and concerns.* Provide practical support.* Connect with professionals.",Punjab Agricultural University reaches out to farmers in distress

BJP MLA Sanjay Sharma on Thursday wrote an open letter to 83 former bureaucrats who demanded UP CM Yogi AdityanathÃ¢ÂÂs resignation over the incident of violence in Bulandshahr. Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre seeing deaths of only Sumit and a police officer but not the deaths of 21 cows,Ã¢ÂÂ Sharma wrote in his letter. Ã¢ÂÂYou should realise that people who killed the cows were the culprit in real terms. Act of the mob was a result of sudden provocation due to killing of Gaumata,Ã¢ÂÂ Sharma said. The BJP lawmakerÃ¢ÂÂs letter came after a group of former bureaucrats had slammed Adityanath and PM Narendra Modi over the Bulandshahr mob violence.
In the open letter, the former officials had said that Ã¢ÂÂpolitics of hate has taken the most dangerous turnÃ¢ÂÂ and the Bulandshahr incident showed the Ã¢ÂÂpervertedÃ¢ÂÂ fundamental principles of governance and constitutional ethics of the Yogi government. The officials said that Ã¢ÂÂhooliganism and thuggery have been mainstreamed into governanceÃ¢ÂÂ.

284,1981,positive,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday pulled up the state for inaction and held it responsible for drastic environmental degradation through unabated sand mining around creeks and in the coastal areas.A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla, while dictating a judgment in a PIL against illegal sand mining in Thane and Palghar districts , said that such illegal excavation has put the danger of a possible collapse Ã¢ÂÂfive important bridgesÃ¢ÂÂ in the area, including Vaitarna bridge . Senior counsel Gayatri Singh, who appeared for local cultivators from Jhaw island in Palghar who had filed the PIL against illegal sand mining in Vaitarna, said the unchecked illegal activity had already led to submergence of small islands in the vicinity. Ã¢ÂÂThe Vaitarna bridge is an important connection for railway route between Mumbai and north India,Ã¢ÂÂ said Singh.The HC said degradation was brought on by Ã¢ÂÂdepartmental lapsesÃ¢ÂÂ and non-implementation of various existing laws and rules to prevent and penalize wrongdoers. The HC directed the state must implement the exhaustive set of rules issued in a January 2018 government resolution and penalize offenders by confiscating vehicles, vessels, and any other means of transportation of the illegally excavated sand.The HC directed the state to seriously consider the plea on demolishing landing sites where sand is illegally stored. The HC also set up vigilance committee, led by the Thane district collector, and told it submit a compliance report in June.According to the petitioner, Vaitarna Creek in Palghar district is being abused by using suction pumps. The petition does not say whether the people who are using the suction pumps and excavating sand are the same people in whose favour permits to excavate sand was given or not. The HC said the Ã¢ÂÂuser of suctions pumps to excavate sand at Vaitarna Creek would definitely affect the environment and geographical territory as contended in the PILÃ¢ÂÂ.",Bombay HC raps Maharashtra for eco-degradation due to sand mining
285,1982,positive,"On Tuesday, as India remembered Mahatma Gandhi, a leader who stood for and preached non-violence, on his birth anniversary, Abrar Babu stood rubbing ointment on his injuries. The 45-year-old sugarcane farmer from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh had a deep gash on his chest. He was one of several thousand farmers who had been stopped at the Delhi border by the water cannons and teargas shells of the CapitalÃ¢ÂÂs police. The farmers were part of the Kisan Kranti Yatra, which had taken off from Haridwar in Uttarakhand on September 23, and wanted to enter Delhi, where the protest march was to culminate.
Ã¢ÂÂI could not see anything for an hour,Ã¢ÂÂ said Babu. Ã¢ÂÂIn five minutes, they fired more than 30 to 40 teargas shells. Why didnÃ¢ÂÂt they stop us in Haridwar itself?Ã¢ÂÂ He then answered the question himself, saying, Ã¢ÂÂIf we enter Delhi, then the whole nation will know that farmers are angry.Ã¢ÂÂ
The farmers Ã¢ÂÂ who came from Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and the sugarcane belt in western Uttar Pradesh Ã¢ÂÂ had a set of 11 demands, including lower diesel prices and electricity tariffs, farm loan waivers, timely payment for their harvested sugarcane, and implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission. The march was organised by the Bharatiya Kisan Union and led by its president, Naresh Tikait. He said the government had accepted just seven demands, and the protests would continue.
Ompal Malik, 63, said he had suffered an injury to his right eye from a rubber bullet.
Many Opposition parties supported the farmers and denounced the police action against them. Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi, Ã¢ÂÂOn International Day of Non-Violence, the BJPÃ¢ÂÂs two-year Gandhi Jayanti celebrations began with the brutal beating of farmers peacefully coming to Delhi. Now, the farmers cannot even air the grievances coming to the Capital!Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂWe will wait till we can go to DelhiÃ¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂThey should have welcomed us with open arms,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dinesh Saini, 55, from Jasoi village in Muzaffarnagar. Ã¢ÂÂWe have every right to come to Delhi. It belongs to us too.Ã¢ÂÂ
Instead, the Delhi Police had put in place arrangements to stop them the previous day itself. The East Delhi deputy commissioner of police had issued orders to impose Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which does not allow the assembly of more than four persons. The police cited a threat to law and order and stated that the prohibitory orders would be in place till October 8.
On Tuesday morning, as the farmers arrived in Uttar PradeshÃ¢ÂÂs Ghaziabad district, which is part of the National Capital Region, they were greeted by yellow barricades and a contingent of police and paramilitary personnel. The Delhi Police said in a statement that they had fired teargas and turned on their water cannons only after some farmers tried to break through the barricades, pelted stones at the police and charged at them with sticks.
Yellow barricades halted the march of the protesting farmers on a stretch of road on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.
Ã¢ÂÂThis was the tractor that drove into the barricades,Ã¢ÂÂ declared 50-year-old farmer Mohammad Zakir, pointing to a blue tractor lying over a crushed barricade even as he stood, unperturbed, atop another tractor.
But he also accused the police of hitting them with Ã¢ÂÂteargas [shells] and spray[ing] hot waterÃ¢ÂÂ on them without any warning. He then declared, Ã¢ÂÂEven if we have to bear bullets, we will wait till we can go to Delhi.Ã¢ÂÂ
Farmers claimed their march was peaceful and that the police had acted without any warning.
Several other farmers Scroll.in spoke with said their march was peaceful, that they had not been stopped all along their route from Haridwar, and that the Delhi Police had given them no warning before going into action.
Ã¢ÂÂWe farmers are armed with nothing,Ã¢ÂÂ said Amit Kumar, a 35-year-old sugarcane grower from Muzaffarnagar. Ã¢ÂÂThere are no stones to throw. This was a peaceful rally and we did not expect that some of us would get hurt.Ã¢ÂÂ He added, Ã¢ÂÂI did not run from there.Ã¢ÂÂ
Many of them expressed their frustration at the government, accusing it of ignoring their demands.
Ã¢ÂÂWe want to speak directly to ModiÃ¢ÂÂ
In the aftermath of the clash Ã¢ÂÂ in which seven policemen were also injured Ã¢ÂÂ large tempos and tractors lined the road on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. They blocked the national highways leading to the Capital. Some farmers slept under the tempos, a few bathed under a water tanker while some looked around for food and drinking water, which were scarce.
The march was halted but many farmers remain. They say their protest will continue till the government meets their demands.
Police and paramilitary personnel kept an eye on them from the side of the road. They refused to answer any questions posed to them.
Many of the waiting farmers expressed their unhappiness with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government.
Police and paramilitary personnel are keeping a close eye on the protesting farmers.
Rekha Devi said she had left her children at home in Shravasti district in Uttar Pradesh to join the march and would wait till all their demands had been met. Ã¢ÂÂThey [the government] are scared of us, that is why they are not letting us in Delhi,Ã¢ÂÂ the 35-year-old said. Ã¢ÂÂWe want to speak directly to [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi. How will we work if the rates of petrol and diesel are so high? We will not vote till our demands are met.Ã¢ÂÂ
This could spell trouble for the BJP in the lead-up to crucial elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan at the year-end and the general elections next year.

Sher Pal, 40, lamented that he had not been paid for his sugarcane for 10 months, while the Uttar Pradesh governmentÃ¢ÂÂs ban on tractors over 10 years old had made matters worse. Ã¢ÂÂWe cannot even afford sugar,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂThe government did not suggest an alternative when they banned old tractors. They have sucked our blood.Ã¢ÂÂ
Some time later, the farmers burnt an effigy of the prime minister as they shouted Ã¢ÂÂModi sarkar, jhooti sarkarÃ¢ÂÂ (Modi government, lying government).
Later in the day, the farmers burnt an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Sukhjinder Singh from PunjabÃ¢ÂÂs Sangrur district, who had marched all the way from Haridwar, said farmers were still waiting for the government to fulfil its promise to implement the Swaminathan CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations made during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Ã¢ÂÂWe are upset,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂElectricity bills are running at Rs 8 per unit, which is too much for us.Ã¢ÂÂ
Added Saini, the farmer from Muzaffarnagar, Ã¢ÂÂTill when does this government want time to meet our demands? We know how to make governments but we know how to break them too.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Malaysian Consultation Council of Islamic Organization (MAPIM) a conglomeration of 200 organizations, has condemned the recent killings in Kashmir.
According to a statement by MAPIM said, the conglomeration regrets the silence of the world community over the atrocities in Kashmir by government forces.
The spokesman in a statement said that report of the detention of the Chairman Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front Yasin Malik, by the forces to curtail the rightful movement to self-determination for Kashmir is unacceptable, and Malik is a legitimate leader of the KashmiriÃ¢ÂÂs struggle for independence.
Ã¢ÂÂIt is most regretful that the UN has stood action less to stop the human violations in the Kashmir,Ã¢ÂÂ the spokesman of the conglomeration said. Ã¢ÂÂWe believe the atrocities inflicted on the Kashmiris by the forces will not break the spirit of the Kashmiris for their struggle for independence and for self-determination,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
The conglomeration also said that keeping Malik in jail and not providing him with basic treatment for his deteriorating health is a criminal act against international law.
The MAPIM spokesman said on record, they have received reports till November 2018, and forces have killed Ã¢ÂÂ48 people, besides arresting 169 and torturing 196.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWe have been informed that in the past decades, the India forces have killed 95, 234 people since January 1989 in which the custodial killing mounted to 7120,Ã¢ÂÂ the statement said.

Inter-state River Water Disputes in India

Most rivers of India are plagued with interstate disputes. Almost all the major rivers of the country are inter-state rivers and their waters are shared by two or more than two states.

After independence, demand for water had been increasing at an accelerated rate due to rapid growth of population, agricultural development, urbanisation, industrialisation, etc. These developments have led to several inter-state disputes about sharing of water of these rivers.

Following interstate river water disputes are worth mentioning.

(i) The Cauvery water dispute between Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.

(ii) The Krishna water dispute between Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

(iii) The Tungabhadra water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

(iv) The Aliyar and Bhivani river water dispute between Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

(v) The Godavari river water dispute between Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Karnataka.

(vi) The Narmada water dispute between Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

(vii) The Mahi river dispute between Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

(viii) The Ravi and Beas river water dispute between Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi.

(ix) The Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal dispute between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.

(x) The Yamuna river water dispute between Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.

(xi) The Karmanasa river water dispute between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

(xii) The Barak river water dispute between Assam and Manipur.

India receives an average of 4,000 billion cubic meters of rainfall every year. Only 48% of rainfall ends up in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs rivers. Due to lack of storage and crumbling infrastructure, only 18% can be utilized. Rainfall is confined to the monsoon season, June through September, when India gets, on average, 75% of its total annual precipitation.

Once again, due to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs storage crunch the government is unable to store surplus water for the dry season. Such uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall has not stimulated the development of better capturing and storing infrastructure, making water scarcity an unnecessary yet critical problem.

Water levels at 91 major reservoirs nationwide are the lowest in a decade Ã¢ÂÂ no more than 29 per cent, according to the Central Water Commission (CWC). The water levels at Indian reservoirs are 71 per cent of last year, or 74 per cent of average storage over the last decade, the CWC data reveal. The 91 major reservoirs contain 157.8 billion cubic metre (BCM) of water; the capacity of these reservoirs is 250 BCM. Another 400 BCM water is available for irrigation in India through groundwater.

A research group in Singapore warned that Himalayan river basins in China, Bangladesh, India and Nepal will face massive water depletion within 20 years, leading to a decline in food and mass migration. Due to natural reasons like glacial melting, the four countries would lose almost 275 billion cubic metres of annual renewable water in the next two decades, more than the total amount of water available in Nepal at present. India-based Strategic Foresight Group said in a report, Ã¢ÂÂWe are certainly heading for a catastrophe that is going to happen in the next 20 Ã¢ÂÂ 25 years and not later.Ã¢ÂÂ Water scarcity and effects like desertification and soil erosion would bring rice and wheat yields in China and India down by as much as 50 per cent by 2050, the researchers warn. This will lead to massive food imports by these two countries with attendant price escalation and non-availability. Water depletion in the river basins would displace millions of people in the four countries by 2050.

Three years ago thousands of villages in MaharashtraÃ¢ÂÂs Marathwada were facing record-breaking drought. They depended solely on water from state-supplied tankers, with the town of Latur supplying water to its people once in three weeks. A n year earlier, the Latur district administration, fearing violence over water, imposed restrictions on assembly. Fodder camps in parched rural Maharashtra shelter not just cattle but hundreds of human families. The government is now recommending that towns and cities stop water supply to swimming pools.

Madhya Pradesh (MP) is bracing for drought and the government is preparing to send tankers to villagers. In Bundelkhand, spread across MP and Uttar Pradesh, there hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been water to sow the winter crop, agricultural productivity has halved and people find it hard to buy salt. In Odisha, farmers have broken embankments of public lakes to save crops.

Inequities in water availability are a reflection of unequal development within the country. 13% of DelhiÃ¢ÂÂs citizens, of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs capital, do not get water supply every day; 40% of households in Madhya Pradesh are not supplied even 40 litres per day. Even if we achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the population without access to drinking water and sanitation by 2020, 244 million people in rural India and 90 million in urban India will still not have access to safe, sustainable water supply. India, as the poorest country in the world in terms of number of people, would also have the correspondingly highest number of people without access to water in absolute terms. Within metropolitan cities, the condition of slum-dwellers is not just bad in terms of quantity and quality; volume for volume, these marginalised sections pay far more for a bucket of water than those who have piped supply. Even in metropolitan cities, leaving out a few posh localities, getting piped water round the clock is a luxury.

Water is both an important input for many different manufacturing and industrial sectors and used as a coolant for machines, such as textile machines. Cheap water that can be rapidly pumped from underground aquifers has been a major factor in the success of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs economic growth.

The demand for drinking water is divided between the urban and rural populations, and comprises about 4-6% of total water demand. Due to the amenities of typical urban life, such as flush toilets and washing machines, people living in cities tend to lead more water intensive lives. The urban population has doubled over the past 30 years, now representing 30% of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs total population and is expected to reach 50% of the total population by 2025.

Population growth is going to accelerate the water crisis in India, especially as more and more people move into the cities and become part of the middle class. Because the river water is too polluted to drink and the government is unable to consistently deliver freshwater to the cities, many urban dwellers are turning to groundwater, which is greatly contributing to the depletion of underground aquifers. Rural citizens face a similar crisis. Currently 30% of the rural population lack access to drinking water, and of the 35 states in India, only 7 have full availability of drinking water for rural inhabitants.

Depleting ground water level may be a real worry if one looks at the future demand of water in India. As per the estimates of Central Water Commission (CWC) the country would need 1,180 billion cubic meter (BCM) of water annually by 2050. India has, at present, annual potential of 1,123 BCM of Ã¢ÂÂutilizableÃ¢ÂÂ water with 690 BCM coming from surface water resources and remaining 433 BCM from ground water resources. But these resources are showing downward trend alarmingly and continuously.

The fall in water levels in wells from 2003 to 2013 in terms of percentage are:

Tamil Nadu Ã¢ÂÂ 76

Punjab Ã¢ÂÂ 72

Kerala Ã¢ÂÂ 71

Karnataka Ã¢ÂÂ 69

Meghalaya Ã¢ÂÂ 66

Haryana Ã¢ÂÂ 65

West Bengal Ã¢ÂÂ 64

Delhi Ã¢ÂÂ 62

Depleting ground water level may be a real worry if one looks at the future demand of water in India. In view of the above projections the country would not be able to meet its future demand unless it recharges its aquifers adequately and uses water more efficiently and judiciously. This is a very tall order in our lackadaisical society.

The dependence of irrigation on groundwater increased with the onset of the Ã¢ÂÂGreen Revolution,Ã¢ÂÂ which depended on intensive use of inputs such as water and fertilizers to boost farm production. Rather than extending surface water irrigation to unirrigated regions, policymakers began providing incentives for groundwater extraction. Private groundwater irrigation was facilitated by extending credit and subsidies for irrigation equipment. However, the centrepiece of government policy has been the massive subsidy provided on electricity supply. Low power tariffs led to excessive water usage, leading to a sharp fall in water tables. The rush to grow cash crops in recent years has only exacerbated the crisis.

IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs agricultural sector currently uses about 90% of total water resources. Irrigated agriculture has been fundamental to economic development, but unfortunately it caused groundwater depletion. Due to water pollution in rivers, India draws 80% of its irrigation water from groundwater. As water scarcity becomes a bigger and bigger problem, rural and farming areas will most likely be hit the hardest. Thus far, food security has been one of the highest priorities for politicians

Surface water Ã¢ÂÂ with rivers as its main source Ã¢ÂÂ is being relentlessly utilised through dams. These dams have robbed some rivers of their usual water flow, while diverting the course of others. The use of surface water is also affected adversely by dams. With over 5,000 dams, India is behind only China and US on this count. While facilitating irrigation and electricity generation, the dams are adversely affecting water quality in the country.

What about pollution in the rivers? Originating from the Yamunotri glacier in the Lower Himalayas, Yamuna is the largest tributary of the Ganges. It flows through several states of North India, and creates a very fertile and alluvial region at its confluence with the Ganges. By far, it is the second most polluted river in India, after the Ganges. Millions of tons of household garbage is discharged into the river each day, and every attempt to curb this has failed till date. Traces of poisonous insecticides have also been found in the Yamuna, recently. Extreme urbanization and soil erosion are also serious causes of concern.

Considered to be the holiest river in Hinduism, the Ganges originates at the Gangotri glacier in the western Himalayas and flows through the Gangetic plain of North India, and then enters Bangladesh, where it meets the Bay of Bengal. In 2007, Ganges was ranked as one of the five most polluted rivers in the world. Owing to its religious association, the contaminants polluting this river are numerous and varied. The pollutants range from toxic industrial waste to sewage to plastics and innumerable religious offerings made to the river each day. Added to this, people bathe in the Ã¢ÂÂholyÃ¢ÂÂ waters, wash their clothes, cook on its banks, and dispatch dead bodies. According to a recent study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the Ganges is so full of toxic pollutants that people staying close to its banks are more susceptible to cancer than anywhere else in India.

The rivers in the country are not useful mainly because of pollution. Because of the establishment of a large number of industrial cities on the bank of river Ganga like Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi and Patna, countless tanneries, chemical plants, textile mills, distilleries, slaughterhouses, and hospitals prosper and grow along this and contribute to the pollution of the Ganga by dumping untreated waste into it. Industrial effluents are about 12% of the total volume of effluent reaching the Ganga. Although a relatively low proportion, they are a cause for major concern because they are often toxic and non-biodegradable. During festival seasons, over 70 million people bathe in the Ganga over a few weeks to cleanse themselves from their past sins. Some materials like food, waste or leaves are left in the Ganga for ritualistic reasons. Many poor people leave the dead bodies of their relatives in the river. Similarly dead bodies of animals float in the river.

Number of rivers defined as Ã¢ÂÂpollutedÃ¢ÂÂ in India has risen from 121 to 275 in the last five years, with increased levels of sewage a primary cause, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India. More than half the rivers in India are polluted, with the developing economic power unlikely to meet demand for fresh water from its still-growing population unless dramatic measures are taken, a new report by government scientists has said. A primary cause is the quantity of sewage generated by cities and towns along polluted stretches the CPCBÃ¢ÂÂs report found. Ã¢ÂÂIn view of population increase, demand for freshwater for all uses will be unmanageable,Ã¢ÂÂ it said. The sewage generated from 650 cities and towns situated along the 302 polluted river stretches has also increased from 38,000 Million Litres per Day (MLD) in 2009 to 62,000 MLD in 2015, the assessment says. Significantly, though relative capacities of the Sewage Treatment Plants have not increased, there has been a massive rise in sewage.

While the treatment capacity of the plants stood at 11,800 MLD in 2009, it has risen to 24,000 MLD. The gap in the treatment capacity has only widened with 26,200 MLD in 2009 to 38,000 MLD in 2015. Based on the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels, the 302 polluted river stretches have been bracketed into five priority classes. The CPCB has placed 34 rivers with BOD values exceeding 30 mg per litre in Priority Class I that means they require urgent attention.

The pollutants in the rivers include oils, greases, plastics, plasticizers, metallic wastes, suspended solids, phenols, toxins, acids, salts, dyes, cyanides, pesticides etc. Many of these pollutants are not easily susceptible to degradation and thus cause serious pollution problems.

Contamination of ground water and fish-kill episodes are the major effects of the toxic discharges from industries. Discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluents leads to a number of conspicuous effects on the river environment. The impact involves gross changes in water quality viz. reduction in dissolved oxygen and reduction in light penetration thatÃ¢ÂÂs tends loss in self purification capability of river water; the river water pollution leads to hazardous impact on aquatic animals and plants. Some studies show alarming condition of river pollution implications. Contamination by synthetic organic pollutants is a more recent phenomenon which is even more difficult to trace for lack of appropriate monitoring.

The catastrophe is looming large in the water availability situation in the country. People know what to do about it but no one is able to force the people to do the right thing. Even the highly educated industrialists are not doing what they ought to do. Let us hope that better sense prevails in the countrymen very shortly.

Senior Manager Radhelal Sinha and Deputy Manager (mining) Omprakash Singh were suspended on Tuesday for alleged negligence, SECL Area General Manager (Korba) J P Dwivedi said on Wednesday.
""The action was taken based on the probe report of the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) into the incident that took place at Bagdewa mines of the SECL, a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd,"" he said.
Both the officials were posted at Bagdewa mines located under Bakimongra police station area, around 250 kms from the state capital Raipur.
Mining supervisor Laxmikant Prasad (42), workers Ramadhar (35) and Ajay (33), were killed on December 16 evening after they allegedly entered into a non-functional tunnel, where the oxygen level was very low.
The probe into the incident by the DGMS pointed negligence on the part of Sinha and Singh. After the report was submitted to the SECL, action was taken against the duo, Dwivedi said.

COIMBATORE: Farmers boycotted uzhavar sandhai on Friday to mark their opposition to the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs move to erect high voltage transmission towers on agriculture lands.Meanwhile, farmersÃ¢ÂÂ protest against the Power Grid Corporation of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs project entered into the fifth day on Friday. Farmers from 13 districts in the state had been staging protest in eight locations against the move to erect high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission towers on agricultural lands. In Coimbatore, farmers were demonstrating at Sultanpet.Electricity minister P Thangamani, however, said farmers were being instigated by political rivals. Ã¢ÂÂCertain elements are instigating the farmers to gain political mileage. The state government is open to hold talks with farmers,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ he said.Pointing out that high voltage transmission towers were being erected to bring electricity from other states, the minister said the compensation to land owners for letting their land to erect the towers was higher in Tamil Nadu, compared to other states. Ã¢ÂÂStill, we are open to hold talks with farmers and give them due compensation.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂIn a novel protest, a group of farmers on Friday spend time in meditation in front of the portrait of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa and represented their grievances to her soul. Ã¢ÂÂAfter AmmaÃ¢ÂÂs demise, O Panneerselvam spend hours in meditation at her memorial on Marina in Chennai and his problems were solved immediately. Similarly, we believe that AmmaÃ¢ÂÂs soul will help solve our problems,Ã¢ÂÂ the farmers said and added that they were also AIADMK members.Requesting the state government not to erect HVDC transmission towers on agricultural lands, they suggested that the ruling dispensation could lay underground cables along roads to carry electricity. The farmers threatened to intensify the protest if the state government werenÃ¢ÂÂt ready to heed their requests.Farmers also boycotted the uzhavar sandhai at Singanallur, extending support to the ongoing protest. Many people were not aware about the boycott and they had to return home empty-handed. More than 150 shops were shut to support the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ protest at Sulthanpet, Senjerimalai, Kamanaickenpalayam and a few other areas in the district. DMK, DMDK, CPI, CPM and various political outfits also extended their support to the farmers.In Tirupur, farmers staged a Ã¢ÂÂhalf-nakedÃ¢ÂÂ protest and opened a Ã¢ÂÂkanji thottiÃ¢ÂÂ (gruel centre) at V Kallipalayam. Extending support to them, more than 3,000 vegetable shops downed their shutters at Palladam and Kangeyam, and the uzhavar sandhai in the district also remained closed. Farmer MLAs Balabaharathi and Karunagaran and former CPM MP Natarajan also participated in the protest.In Salem, farmers staged protest at Vazhapadi.It is to be noted that the Power Grid Corporation of India and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Ltd are planning to erect transmission towers on agricultural lands in 13 districts to carry electricity to Thrissur in Kerala, Thruvallam in Vellore, Edayarpalayam and Arasur in the district and a few other areas from Pugalur HVDC substation.",Farmers intensify protest against bid to erect transmission towers
291,2010,positive,"The Congress said on Wednesday that the BJP governments at the Centre and in various States have been consistently against farmers. The police action against farmers at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border is just the latest illustration of it, according to the Congress.
Ã¢ÂÂBe it in Madhya Pradesh, be it in Maharashtra or be it in Rajasthan, attacking protesting farmers has become a trademark of the BJP governments. The BJP always turned a blind eye towards the issues of farmers,Ã¢ÂÂ CongressÃ¢ÂÂs media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters at a press conference here on Wednesday.
Ready to waive loan
He said the Centre waived loans of Ã¢ÂÂ¹ 3,17,000 crore belonging to industrialists. Ã¢ÂÂWhy the BJP hasnÃ¢ÂÂt taken any action on the demand of farmers that their loans should be waived?Ã¢ÂÂ Surjewala asked. Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said on Tuesday that his party is ready to waive the loans of farmers just as the UPA did in 2009.
Crop Insurance Scheme
Surjewala also alleged that the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs Crop Insurance scheme benefits private insurance companies only. Ã¢ÂÂThe Modi Government earned Ã¢ÂÂ¹ 19,000 crore in 2016-17 and 2017-18 through the Krishi Kalyan Cess. And Ã¢ÂÂ¹14,828 crore was paid to insurance companies as premium whereas farmers received only Ã¢ÂÂ¹5,650 crore,Ã¢ÂÂ Surjewala said.
He said sugarcane farmers are yet to be paid Ã¢ÂÂ¹16,600 crore dues. Ã¢ÂÂWhen will this be paid?Ã¢ÂÂ he asked and added that the prices of almost all agriculture input have been increased in the last four years. Ã¢ÂÂWhy was price of fertiliser increased? In 2014, fertiliser price was Ã¢ÂÂ¹ 1,125 per 50 kg. Today the price is Ã¢ÂÂ¹1,400,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.
He said the promise of an increased MSP was just a jumla. Ã¢ÂÂIn 2014, Modi had promised 50 per cent more on the MSP for farmersÃ¢ÂÂ produce. What happened to that promise now,Ã¢ÂÂ Surjewala asked.
2017 protest
Surjewala said in 2017, farmers from Tamil Nadu, suffering the onslaught of a severe drought demonstrated at the Jantar Mantar. Ã¢ÂÂThese farmers had brought with them the skeletons of their fellow farmers, but the the Prime Minister instead of giving any relief, even refused a meeting with them,Ã¢ÂÂ Surjewala alleged.
From Nashik to Mumbai
In March 2018, he said, 50,000 farmers walked from Nashik to Mumbai a distance of 200 kilometres to knock at the door of the BJP Government. Ã¢ÂÂThey were bleeding to the inner most corner of their psyche. But the BJP Government refused to acknowledge the promises made by them. In April 2018, demanding compensation for 4,000 acres of acquired land in Bhavnagar in Gujarat were lathi-charged,Ã¢ÂÂ he added.",Violence is BJPÃ¢ÂÂs answer to farmersÃ¢ÂÂ questions: Cong

A 25-year-old farmer was on Sunday attacked by a tiger in the Khandar area of the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, a top forest official said.

The victim, identified as Ramkesh Gujjar, a resident of Ganesh Nagar village on the periphery of the reserve, had taken his goats for grazing in the forest when he was mauled by the tiger, said Ranthambore field director YK Sahu.

Ã¢ÂÂHe received injuries on his eyes, back and neck, and has been referred to the SMS hospital in Jaipur,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.

Earlier too incidents of man-animal conflicts have been reported from the Khandar area of the reserve. In May 2015, a 35-year-old man was attacked by a tiger in the buffer area of Khandar. He received a head injury but later recovered.

Similarly in November 2017, a tiger entered the fields in Talwada village in Khandar and attacked Gori Shankar, a farmer.

Expert said such man-animal conflicts would increase in the future due to the increase in the number of big cat population in the reserve.

The tiger population in the reserve has increased to 70, the highest in the in reserveÃ¢ÂÂs history, some of them said.

During drought, when there is lack of water or fodder, villagers enter the forest in search of fodder for the cattle which increase the chances of man-animal conflicts, they said.

The state forest department will soon relocate tigers to the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve from Ranthambore in what will be the countryÃ¢ÂÂs first relocation of big cats to decongest a wildlife habitat.

India and Sweden will co-host the India-Nordic Summit in Stockholm on Tuesday which will see participation of Narendra Modi and Prime Ministers of all Nordic countries--Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

On the sidelines, Prime Minister Modi will also have separate bilateral meetings with counterparts from Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway. Ahead of the summit, IcelandÃ¢ÂÂs Ambassador to India Thorir Ibsen spoke to Smita Sharma about the significance of the summit meeting, the big-ticket items, including climate change cooperation and green and clean technology transfer possibilities multilaterally with the group and bilaterally with Iceland.

The envoy says that shooting the song Ã¢ÂÂGeruaÃ¢ÂÂ in the film Ã¢ÂÂDilwaleÃ¢ÂÂ in the scenic Icelandic landscapes impacted ties positively and Bollywood productions increased there. Iceland wants a serious reform of the United Nations Security Council with India on the high table. Iceland that suffered a national banking crisis a decade ago also has words of advice for India which finds banking frauds making constant headlines. Accept advice from abroad and punish the guilty, says envoy Ibsen. HereÃ¢ÂÂs the exclusive Interview with The Tribune.

How important is this first India-Nordic summit? What are the takeaways expected?

What is significant about this meeting is that the Indian Prime Minister has taken the initiative to meet all Nordic PMs at the same time. This is a great opportunity for all PMs to meet together for the first as I recall. There has always been a good political, trade and investment relations between Nordic countries and India. But these relations need to be deepened. Trade has to be further increased. Lots of opportunity there in areas of innovation, digital transformation and generating growth and jobs by increasing trade.

What are the big-ticket items on the Summit agenda?

Innovation, growth, jobs and trade is one. Security issues, including contemporary ones that we are dealing with. Third, climate change and empowerment of women.

With TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs opposition to the climate change pact, what kind of role do you think India can play on the issue?

India was a key player in conclusion of the summit in Paris. India is a huge economy and huge player internationally. India has been showing leadership with couple of initiatives like the solar alliance. India has announced substantial increase in renewable energy up to 175 GW by 2022. These are substantial contributions from India. On climate change, the Nordic countries and India see eye to eye. We all are strong supporters of Paris Agreement and Nordic countries are champions when it comes to renewable energy. President Trump has never said that he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt want to do anything about climate change. He doesnÃ¢ÂÂt like the Paris Agreement.

But lots of cooperation still takes place between Nordic and European countries and US on climate change-related issues. There are consultations; private sector is working on technology. NGOs are active, not as if the clock has stopped. But we would want the US administration evidently to be more forthcoming on climate change.

In bilateral talks with Iceland, what is going to be the key area?

This is a bilateral talk taking place in context of the multilateral Nordic summit meet with Indian PM. So not the same as giving bilateral talks in IcleandÃ¢ÂÂs capital. What the PM of Iceland will be emphasising with PM Modi will be increased trade, geo-thermal and renewable energy, climate change and research and what we can do for cooperation in gender equality and empowerment of women and entrepreneurial sectors.

With IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs special relation with Moscow and DC, will the current state of tensions between US and Europe versus Russia be discussed?

Not so far. You are dealing with a situation that is evolving and changing every minute. This summit was decided a long time before the events taking place now. However, if something happens now Prime Ministers will not be able to ignore what is going on. But nothing for the time being.

Iceland was one of the first countries supporting IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs aspiration for a Security Council seat. How do you view the progress speed?

We have been, like many other countries, disappointed with the process and the pace of reforms of the UN and Security Council. We rely on a strong United Nations and well functioning Security Council. We are of the view that the Security Council must reflect the current historical realities. Our position vis a vis India is based both on friendship because we trust India and also in recognition that in a changed world India should be at the table. Our support for India in UNSC is there. We are engaged in negotiations in New York like all other member states but the resistance does not come from us.

How is IcelandÃ¢ÂÂs financial health today some years after the last major crisis?

IcelandÃ¢ÂÂs financial crisis was an unfortunate situation. All that has been explained and presented in the media. There were culprits that were brought to justice and many bankers are now in jail or in probation. The economy is back, the financial sector has been reformed. You do not reform everything overnight. There are some things we still want to fine-tune. We are now experiencing 4.6 per cent economic growth. We have to be careful to ensure it does not get overheated. But a banking crisis is not a possibility in Iceland now.

With ongoing frauds in public sector banks in India, can it learn something from IcelandÃ¢ÂÂs experience?

Things can happen to economies. Accept advice from abroad. We had a national crisis, we accepted the advice of the IMF because we realised that we needed to have an external view on what went wrong. If we were analysing ourselves it would not be good. You need someone from the outside to tell you what is wrong in the household, then you can move on. Make those responsible accountable.

How have the India-Iceland relations changed in past four years?

I see a significant change. We share values like democracy, human rights, peaceful resolution of conflicts, climate change and work together. But the relationship we are cultivating in Delhi are business and commercial relations. On people-to-people side we have had a 50 per cent yearly increase over the past four years of tourists visiting Iceland. Of the 2 million tourists we receive annually, we now have around 20,000-25000 Indian tourists. We are hoping for a direct flight between India and Iceland soon. Bollywood has been looking towards us favourably. We are having popular productions from India every year considering we are a small nation of 330,000 people. The biggest production was Ã¢ÂÂGeruaÃ¢ÂÂ, the feature song of Ã¢ÂÂDilwaleÃ¢ÂÂ which received 200 million views on YouTube. That has completely transformed relations.

We have tried to work on other business relations. We have two of our biggest companies working in India. One is high-tech company in foot processing industry and the other produces prosthetics and medical equipment. Other companies in areas of medical supplies, biotechnology, healing materials are coming into the market here. The main stumbling block in our commercial relations is the absence of FTA (Free Trade Agreement). Small countries like ours want to make sure that trade is based on rules that are transparent and predictable. Our companies from small countries are always reluctant to do much business with countries you do not have such bilateral agreements with. We are currently negotiating in context of AFTAÃ¢ÂÂthe non-EU agreement talks for which started in 2008. We are negotiating parallel to the EU as we are part of the internal market despite not being member of EU. When we complete the talks it will transform our trade relations completely.

What is the green technology that India could gain from Iceland?

We are the biggest geothermal energy producers in the world. Our share of renewable is almost 90 per cent. We heat all our houses with hot water, we produce electricity with it. We have massive knowledge of developing, designing and implementing geothermal projects. Our companies are working in North Africa, Central America and in Asia. Our companies have been building geo-thermal heating facilities for cities in China of up to 350 million people. You drill a hole, get hot water out and lead it like gas to the houses. You can imagine the emissions relief. We have that technology and we want to bring that to India which has geothermal capacity that needs to be studied and developed.

We also have lots of experience in hydro sector. In environmental technologies, we capture carbon emissions coming out from stations or plants and pump them down into sediments into the ground and transform them into rock. That is a technology India might need from us. We also have companies working towards energy savings using IT especially for marines, helping fishing boats and cargo ships to minimise energy consumption. In food processing technology key thing today is not losing resources. There is a huge part of India that consumes meat and fish. So while meat and fish can be cultivated in farms or caught wild but you want to get maximum yield out of every bit of it. We discovered high technology to maximise yields by X-raying every animal going into the machines that cut them hygienically using water and reduces waste which is important for sustainability.","Banking crisis not a possibility in Iceland now, envoy tells Tribune"

The decision was taken after hundreds of such people gathered at Panaji Friday, said Puti Gaonkar, president of the GMPF.
The mining sector in Goa has come to a standstill after the Supreme Court, in an order in February this year, quashed 88 mining leases and banned the extraction of fresh ore from March.
""We will be pressing for an amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)Act2015 as well as Goa, Daman andDiuMiningConcessions (Abolitionand Declaration asMiningLeases)Act, 1987. This will help extend life of Goa mining leases till 2037,"" he said.
GMPF leaders Friday met Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai, Congress Leader of Opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar, Shiv Sena Goa vice president Rakhi Prabhudesai Naik and AAP Goa president Elvis Gomes for support.
While Sardesai put the onus on resumption of the mining sector on the BJP, as it was in power in Goa as well as the Centre, Congress leader Kavlekar said that an all-party delegation should meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a solution.
The Sena's Naik said the party was committed to supporting mining dependents who have been left in the lurch due to the ban.

295,2031,positive,"The first day of the 10-day winter session of the Karnataka legislature that began at Belagavi on Monday witnessed massive protests by farmers in the city. While the sugarcane growers staged a protest before the deputy commissionerÃ¢ÂÂs office, the farmer groups with allegiances to the BJP and JD(S) held separate rallies, reiterating similar demandsÃ¢ÂÂ total farm loan waiver, drought relief measures across 17 districts, setting up of procurement centres, payment of arrears to sugarcane farmers and implementation of irrigation projects in north Karnataka region.
With the JD(S)-Congress coalition governmentÃ¢ÂÂs farm loan waiver scheme proving to be a non-starter, as the much promised debt-free certificates are yet to reach the farmers, the BJP seems to have sensed a political opportunity as its leaders allege Ã¢ÂÂstep-motherly attitudeÃ¢ÂÂ by the Kumaraswamy government towards the north Karnataka region. While the BJP legislators rushed to the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ rally organised by the Raita Morcha immediately after the customary condolence references in the house, cooperation minister Bandeppa Kashempur, too, rushed to a rally organised by farmer organisations like the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), Karnataka State Sugarcane GrowersÃ¢ÂÂ Association (KSSGA) and Hasiru Sene under the leadership of Kodihalli Chandrashekhar to pacify the agitating farmers.
Launching a tirade against the coalition government, former chief minister Yeddyurappa equated the coalition rule to Ã¢ÂÂTuglaq durbarÃ¢ÂÂ and vowed to fight for the farmerÃ¢ÂÂs cause both inside and outside the assembly.
Ã¢ÂÂFor the last six months, Kumaraswamy has been chanting loan waiver and neglected all development works in the state. Farmer suicides due to mounting debt are on the rise. But the CM has failed to implement the loan waiver. In a face saving bid, he has distributed debt-free certificates to only a few farmers ahead of the legislature session. Nowhere in independent India have we come across a CM who speaks ill of women, the opposition and the media who question his government. We will launch a statewide protest. Five teams of BJP MLAs have toured the drought-hit areas and we hear of distressed sale of cattle to slaughter houses. I want to ask the CM if his government is alive? Have any of your ministers visited the drought-hit districts?,Ã¢ÂÂ said Yeddyurappa adding that massive farmers protests indicated that people had no trust in this government.
Hitting back at his detractors, Yeddyurappa said that he would not be sidelined owing to his old age. Ã¢ÂÂLet me assure you, I will remain strong for another 15 years,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. The three-day old government led by Yeddyurappa had collapsed on May 19, with the chief minister announcing his decision to resign without facing a trust vote. Ã¢ÂÂMy critics believe this was my last stint as the CM and I will fade away. It was a bad luck that we fell short of a majority though we were the single largest party by winning 104 seats. In about 30 seats, we lost by a small margin. Had the BJP come to power, we would not have let down the farmers,Ã¢ÂÂ said the Lingayat strongman.
Former Athani MLA and Raita Morcha president Laxman Savadi claimed that the arrears of sugarcane was Rs 1,600 crore in three districts of Belagavi, bagalkot and Vijayapura and most of the defaulters (sugar factory owners) were part of the ruling party. Ã¢ÂÂThe state government should pay the sugarcane farmers their arrears instead of settling the bills for power purchased from these defaulting sugar factory owners,Ã¢ÂÂ said Savadi.
Former deputy chief minister R. Ashok charged that the JD(S) was ruling the state through Holenarsipura. The BJP leader accused the chief minister and the government of neglecting the north Karnataka region.
Earlier, Dharwad MP Prahlad Joshi lamented that the state government had failed to open procurement centres for all crops except paddy. Ã¢ÂÂThe Centre has fixed the MSP for 25 crops, but the state is not inclined to facilitate procurement. The Swaminathan Committee report tabled in 2006 was not implemented by the UPA. Swaminathan has lauded the Modi government for implementing his report, while the previous governments slept over it,Ã¢ÂÂ said Joshi.
Udupi-Chikmaglur MP Shobha Karandlaje reminded Kumarswamy that he had vowed to waive off farm loan before the deities of Dharmasthala and Sringeri. Ã¢ÂÂEven after six months, none of the farmers' loan has been waived off. He is trying to mislead the farmers by distributing debt free certificates to a few in Chikkaballapur and Sedam. Yeddyurappa had tabled a separate agriculture budget, waived off farm loan and gave power subsidies. When farmers are demanding power, you boast of selling power abroad. This is an anti-farmer stand. In Mysuru, the water resources minister wants to build a Disneyland at a cost of Rs 1,500 crore, when the dam (sluice) gates are in need of repair.

Agro-forestry or farm forestry will be IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs key strategy to reduce its carbon footprint so as to meet its goals under the Paris climate agreement according to the submission the country plans to make at the COP 24 climate conference thatÃ¢ÂÂs being held in Poland.

The forest conservation division of the union environment ministry has readied a document which will be presented during COP 24 underway at Katowice in Poland, as part of IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) strategy.

India plans to partner with the private sector in scaling up its agro-forestry efforts. This is, however, a controversial subject because environmental activists are against India allowing any private or corporate forestry projects on forest land.

India, through various forestry projects including agroforestry, aims to sequester about 2.5 to 3 billion tones of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2030.

Ã¢ÂÂThis is our aim in our REDD+ strategy. One of the key strategies will be to go big on agro-forestry. There are many other strategies too like treatment and protection of forest catchments,Ã¢ÂÂ said a senior forest division official who asked not to be named. The Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) has worked on the proposal of carbon sequestration from forests in India.

The agro-forestry aspect of the policy has three options.

It can be taken up in non-forest government land with intervention from the private sector; on degraded or not notified forest land under the government with equal partnership from the private sector; or on common land with the consent of local communities.

Ã¢ÂÂProfits from the projects will be shared with the community. Such projects will be taken up by private corporations only if local people agree. Its important because this strategy can help increase farmersÃ¢ÂÂ incomes,Ã¢ÂÂ the official added.

According to the United Nations, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is an effort to value the carbon stored in forests as a way to create incentives for developing countries to protect their environment. India announced its target of creating a carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tones in its intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) during the negotiations in Paris in 2015. The Paris Agreement was adopted and opened for ratification at the 21st Conference of the Parties (CoP) to the UNFCCC in December 2015. Other INDC focus areas include reducing emissions intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) by 33- 35% from 2005 levels and to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources, both by 2030.

Murli Dhar, director, sustainable agriculture, WWF India said: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a good strategy which will help India adapt to climate change. But, there are certain concerns with its implementation. First is that the lock-in period of these plantations is a minimum of four years.

Secondly, India should do a trade-off analysis of how farm forestry will impact food security going forward. There should also be a buy back mechanism of timber from farmers. We are a timber deficit country and import in large quantities from Africa and East Asia, so the strategy makes sense.Ã¢ÂÂ

The proposal has ticked off some environmental activists who think private engagement will undermine the rights of forest dwellers. Ã¢ÂÂThe national REDD+ strategy is developed primarily from a failed model of colonial era forest management with adoption of legal and policy instruments such as compensatory afforestation fund (CAF) Act, Green India Mission, Joint Forest Management which undermine democratic governance of forests and legal rights of adivasis and forest dwellers. The REDD strategies promote massive mono-cultural plantations. The government should make a serious attempt to overhaul the country strategy to ensure its compliance to the forest rights act and governance of forests by gram sabhas,Ã¢ÂÂ said Tushar Dash of Community Forest Rights-Learning and Advocacy (CFR-LA), a research group.

Ã¢ÂÂWe need to explore community forestry for public lands. For private land, there is a need to explore both forest department and state agriculture department promoted agro- forestry, in addition to involving the private sector,Ã¢ÂÂ said NH Ravindranath, climate and forestry scientist at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.

Coupled with landslips, the rains have adversely affected plantation crops such as ginger, black pepper, cardamom coffee, nutmeg, rubber and tea. Though government agencies are yet to ascertain the quantum of loss in the plantation sector, farming sources said that the loss incurred by the sector is about Ã¢ÂÂ¹2,100 crore in Karnataka and Ã¢ÂÂ¹800 crore in Kerala.
Farmers cultivating short term crop such as ginger were relieved when they received good pre-monsoon showers in April. But ginger farms in Kerala and Karnataka submerging in floods starting June has dampened their hopes. Ginger rhizomes have since been affected by the soft rot disease. Heavy rains in ginger growing regions of Mysuru, Coorg, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Shimoga districts in Karnataka and Wayanad, Palakkad, Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts in Kerala in June flooded the fields.
Ã¢ÂÂI have spent nearly Ã¢ÂÂ¹50 lakh to cultivate ginger on 10 acres of leased land but I am not sure if I can recoup even a quarter of the expense,Ã¢ÂÂ said Manjunath, a farmer at Kushalnagar in Coorg.
The rains wiped out ginger rhizomes on almost 5,000 hectares in Karnataka and 2,500 hectares in Kerala, Navrang Mohanan, president, South Indian Ginger GrowersÃ¢ÂÂ Association told The Hindu.

Ã¢ÂÂHigh moisture content owing to [the] rains has triggered fungal diseases like quick wilt and soft wilt.Ã¢ÂÂ Pepper production may fall 40-50% next season, he added.
Cardamom plants cultivated on hundreds of acres have been destroyed even as the cardamom season has just begun. K.S. Mathew, president, Vandanmedu Green Gold Cardamom farmer Producer Company in Idukki said there would be a 30%-40% fall in total production this season .
The floods have also hit nutmeg, a promising crop gaining popularity in Kerala. Close to 80% of the 22,070 hectares of land used for cultivation were also affected.
The Coffee Board has launched a comprehensive calamity survey to assess the loss in the coffee sector, including crop loss, damage to plants, green berry dropping and shedding of berries owing to black rot disease, due to the flood, M. Karutha Mani, deputy director, Coffee Board (Extension) said.
However coffee industry sources said Ã¢ÂÂArabicaÃ¢ÂÂ coffee production is likely to fall about 30% and the Robusta variety by about 20% in the country in 2018-19 owing to the flooding and landslips in major coffee growing areas.

While BJP members wanted the Congress leaders to convince their Goan counterparts to allow their Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to settle the issue amicably, the JD(S) and the Congress leaders sought the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs intervention for amicable settlement of the dispute.

301,2056,positive,"With all eyes on the hearing of Jammu Kashmir Resettlement Act in the Supreme Court, any decision would draw flak. The Supreme Court has asked J&K GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs counsels to enumerate the number of applications made for permanent return under the Act. While the matter is sub-judice, a wrong picture is being painted to gain momentum against the repealing of the act.
The act allows the ones from Jammu Kashmir who opted to go to Pakistan in 1947 to return to the state as permanent residents with all rights, thus resettling them in the state. This includes those who migrated to Pakistan from Jammu Kashmir and those residing in Pakistan Occupied Jammu Kashmir. About a million people who opted for Pakistan can claim to become the stateÃ¢ÂÂs subjects at any time. Twenty-five seats in the present 76-member Assembly are left vacant for them. The bill specifically applies to the persons and decedents of families originally from J&K who are now settled in Pakistan.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs ironic how the special status of Jammu Kashmir has been under a design made available to the ones who are now being proxy ruled by the belligerent Pakistan. The fact that there is no such privilege given to the ones who were displaced to India in 1947 by Pakistan, speaks of a calculated attempt at patronising and polarising by the then National Conference Government which would bear political fruit over time.
Similar provision was made available under Article 5 and 7 of the Indian Constitution on humane considerations which states that those who migrated to Pakistan can return under a law of the legislature but it was in a regulated manner and given a time-frame. However, the J&K Resettlement Act was suddenly brought out after 35 years of the event; clearly politically motivated and designed on communal lines.
Although the provision is in place, such law has larger implications on the security of the state. Pakistani deep StateÃ¢ÂÂs involvement and acts of terror by the terrorist organisations in Jammu Kashmir have raised red flags on implementation of such act. Amid other things, this would drastically change the demography of the state specially a particular region with the ongoing Ã¢ÂÂmajority enjoying minority statusÃ¢ÂÂ subterfuge in the state. This would further affect the JammuÃ¢ÂÂs long standing demand of fair delimitation which, if done, could challenge the monopoly of Kashmir-centric parties over their perpetual majority in Jammu Kashmir assembly. The status quo has fully underwritten the Kashmir-centric monopolist politics that has hit badly the true democratic setup in the state.

Thousands of activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) started Kisan Kranti Yatra from Haridwar and announced it would reach Delhi on Tuesday to coincide with the 149th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The BKU is raising various demands including a farm loan waiver, pension for farmers over 60 years of age and reduced electricity tariffs.
BKU national spokesman Rakesh Tikait claimed the Uttar Pradesh government and the Modi government had not fulfilled the demands of the farmers. ""We have organised the march to press for implementation of the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations, loans waiver and scrapping of a ban on plying of 10-year-old tractors in the national capital region among others,"" he said.
According to media reports, nearly 30,000 farmers are part of the Kisan Kranti Yatra. The BKU had earlier asked for permission to march to the 'Lutyens' area of Delhi where Central ministries are located.
The BKU march will pass through Ghaziabad (in Uttar Pradesh) and will proceed via Preet Vihar and Geeta Colony flyover in East Delhi on Tuesday. ""A large number of protesters are likely to come to Delhi from bordering areas of east district. This may create law and order situation and may disturb the peace and tranquillity and endanger human life or property in the area of east district,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Pankaj Singh said.

Nagpur: Amid efforts to increase forest cover to the mandatory 33%, Maharashtra has lost 17 sq km forest, more than four times the area of Lonar wildlife sanctuary in Buldhana district.The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2017 was released recently by Forest Survey of India (FSI), based on the interpretation of satellite data from October 2015 to January 2016. This shows forest cover in the state in 2015 was 50,699 sq km, whereas in 2017 it has decreased to 50,682 sq km, a loss of 17 sq km. The report is released every two years.Shockingly, of the 35 districts, 20 have shown decrease in forest cover compared to 2015. FSI attributes net decrease in forest cover to rotational tree felling in territorial forest and by FDCM, besides submergence of area, agriculture expansion and development activities.However, Nashik-based expert on forest land issues Hemant Chhajed says FSI has not considered huge encroachments and forest land grab under Forest Rights Act (FRA) as major reasons for decline in forest cover.Chhajed said as per FSI of 1987, Maharashtra had 64,055 sq km forest. Now, it has decreased to 50,682 sq km, a loss of 2,318 sq km. Ã¢ÂÂEven if officials claim that most of the forest area has been diverted for projects, an equivalent area has to be compensated by project proponents, and if such area is not available, compensatory afforestation has to be done on equal land. So, forest cover should increase and not decrease. It is a failure of officials,Ã¢ÂÂ said Chhajed.However, even as forest cover is being lost every year, officials are content with increase in tree cover from 9,558 in 2015 to 9,831 in 2017, and increase in mangrove forest in Western Maharashtra by 82 sq km. A release issued by APCCF (conservation) picked up only the positive side of the FSI report.However, Mumbai-based environmentalist Debi Goenka said, Ã¢ÂÂActually speaking, the mangrove cover is stagnant. In 2005, when the Bombay high court directed mapping of mangroves, it was 340 sq km. The FSI report puts it to 304 sq km. So where is the increase?Ã¢ÂÂState wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, Ã¢ÂÂIt is difficult to see forest cover going up in the years to come unless forest degradation is stopped, and encroachments and biotic pressure are controlled. Besides, there is no forest regeneration.Ã¢ÂÂThe report also states that Maharashtra has lost forest cover within recorded forest area (RFA) in all three categories Ã¢ÂÂ very dense forest (VDF), moderately dense forest (MDF) and open forest (OF). RFA includes forest inside the forest boundaries.The VDF in 2017 is 8,027 sq km while in 2015 it was 8,361 sq km. Similarly, MDF, which was 15,939 sq km has been reduced to 14,168 sq km, and OF which was 13,143 sq km is 11,596 sq km now. Overall recorded forest area has been reduced by 3,652 sq km.Ã¢ÂÂThis decline doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean that this much area has gone. It is quite possible that its status or class must have changed,Ã¢ÂÂ said a senior FSI official.On the contrary, officials claimed forest cover outside recorded forest area has increased by 3,706 sq km from 13,185 sq km to 16,891 sq km. Chhajed says this may be due to various government and private agencies taking up plantations on their lands.RTI activist Avinash Prabhune claimed that FSI has not considered encroachments under the Forest Rights Act. According to information received under RTI by Prabhune, 2.80 lakh individual titles on forest land have been rejected by the district level committee.Ã¢ÂÂRejected titles mean those in possession of these forest lands are encroachments. Even if an individual is considered to be in possession of bare minimum one acre forest land, it will run into 2.80 lakh acres,Ã¢ÂÂ says Prabhune.",State forest cover down by 17 sq km

The district mining department will be leasing out four sand mining sites at Loni this month, officials said, adding that two sites have already been allotted while two more will be allotted through e-tendering and e-auction on January 16.

Two alloted sites are at Pychara village near the Yamuna river zone in Loni while the other two sites have been identified at Nauraspur and Badarpur.

Loni in Ghaziabad and parts of Delhi, are separated by the river, and had also been proposed as mining sites during the tenure of the previous government.

Ã¢ÂÂThe two sites at Pyachara (I & II) have been auctioned for Ã¢ÂÂ¹17.11 crore and Ã¢ÂÂ¹13.83 crore, respectively. The amount of royalty is for one year and there will be 10% increase in the amount every subsequent year. The lease will be for a period of five years,Ã¢ÂÂ said Ashish Kumar, district mining officer.

The other two sites at Nauraspur and Badarpur will be tendered and e-auctioned on January 16.

Ã¢ÂÂWe have nearly 30km stretch of river Yamuna in our jurisdiction where the four sites will have a total of nearly 37.78 hectre area and the lease holders will be able to mine nearly 7.63 lakh cubic metre of sand per year. The limit for the mining of sand has been fixed and nothing beyond this is permissible,Ã¢ÂÂ Kumar added.

The officials said no lease could be executed during the last five years as the parties moved court and the issue of sand mining lease got caught up in litigation. They said that it was a lease which was allotted in Pyachara for 3-4 months but no other lease could be executed.

Ã¢ÂÂIllegal mining is rampant in these areas and there are hardly any checks and enforcement. Apart from the authorised sites, there is a lot of illegal mining activity which takes place in the river stream and is should not be allowed. If there are checks, the officials will also find many trolleys in the interior of neighbouring villages and suspected to be result of illegal mining,Ã¢ÂÂ Sushil Raghav, an environment activist said.

The officials said they lack staff and has only one officer and three home guards to conduct checks in isolated areas, where mafia rules, and sometimes prove a threat to the checking teams.

Barricades were set up and tear gas and water cannons used to prevent the marchers from entering Delhi in order to protest the economic distress that farmers are now facing in India. The blockading soon led to violence with reports coming in of both farmers as well as policemen being injured.
The financial distress faced by cultivators is the Indian economyÃ¢ÂÂs elephant in the room. The steadily worsening productivity of the agricultural sector is not getting the attention it deserves. Farms in India are tiny and getting smaller. As per the 2015 agricultural census, the average landholding size has been estimated at 1.15 hectare and is in decline since 1970-Ã¢ÂÂ71.
To add to that, farming in India has fallen severely behind in adopting of modern techniques. Only 46% of Indian farmland can access modern irrigation. When it comes to IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs largest crop, rice, Chinese farmers manage a productivity nearly three times that of their Indian counterpart. Vietnamese, Indonesian and Bangladeshi rice farming is almost twice as productive as India Ã¢ÂÂ the figures are 233%, 216% and 183% respectively.
Farming in India is often not viable, and what makes it worse is that the country has been unable to set up industries to absorb people who want to leave agriculture, and as a result there are no alternative employment opportunities.
Much of this distress has to do with governmental neglect. On the one hand, the Union government often prioritises consumer welfare over farmersÃ¢ÂÂ commercial interests by fixing import-export rules in order to keep food prices low. On the other hand, the government has made no investments in technology or educating the farmers with an aim to increase productivity.
This neglect of the farmer reaches an apogee when even their right to protest is sought to be denied. Peaceful assembly and free speech are natural rights in any democracy and it is unclear how the Union government could stop farmers from assembling in Delhi in order to draw attention to their plight.
Farmers in India were once the bedrock of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs democratic politics. Their concerns remained the focal point for Mohandas Gandhi, whose birth anniversary India celebrated on Tuesday. It was also the birth anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri, the countryÃ¢ÂÂs second prime minister, who famously saluted the farmers with the slogan Jai Kisan.

On one hand we over-exploit our rivers, lakes, groundwater and other sources of water, but on the other hand we allow colossal amounts to run off into the sea unutilized. The Minister emphasized the role of participatory water management in addressing the problem of water scarcity in the country. He said, to address this problem, the Government, the civil society and the local level communities must all work together to find ways to preserve , protect and augment the available water resource. Shri Gadkari pointed to examples from states like Maharashtra and Gujarat where such participatory management of water have helped turn water starved, barren farmlands into fields producing multiple crops in a year.

Through a presentation by Member, Central Ground Water Board informed the Committee that ground water in India provides for about 60 % of the countrys irrigation needs, 85 % of rural drinking water requirements and 50 % of urban water needs. As per 2013 data, 4 percent of Ground Water assessment units in the country are in a critical state and 10 percent in a semi critical state due to over-exploitation and contamination. The reasons for this over exploitation and contamination include increasing demand , change in cropping pattern, scanty rainfall in arid and semi-arid regions, flat rate/ free subsidized electricity for extracting ground water in certain states, rapid pace of urbanization haphazard sewage and waste disposal.

The Central Ground Water Board has identified various key issues regarding ground water management. It has been established that long term sustainability of water resources can be assuted only through holistic management programmes that take care of both demand side and supply side management. Supply side management focuses on management of aquifer systems and recharge of ground water resources while demand side management involves efforts at arresting decline in ground water levels by regulating the withdrawals and increasing water use efficiency. Demand side management is thus dependent on community participation . It requires the community to make efforts at ensuring that water is extracted in a sustainable manner, the cropping pattern is suited to the area, drip / sprinkler irrigation is encouraged , and people of the community resort to water budgeting.

The Committee agreed upon the need to promote and encourage participatory management as a solution to long term, sustainable development of ground water resources in the country. Participatory management recognizes ground water as a Common Property Resource. When this management method is employed to manage ground water the local communities themselves regulate the extraction and use of water, and are also proactive in augmenting and recharging the resource. Participatory management of ground water have resulted in many success stories in the states of Maharashtra (Tamaswada Nalah Treatment), Gujarat (Upleta Taluk, Rajkot), Maharashtra (Beed, Jalna, Satara) Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu (Annavasal) to name a few.

The Government has taken many initiatives to encourage participatory ground water management by facilitating an enabling environment, creating a knowledge base, sensitizing communities and building capacities. The proposed Atal Bhujal Yojana is also an effort in this direction. It is a Rs 6000 crore Central scheme that aims at sustainable ground water management with emphasis on demand side interventions with community participation in 78 districts covering states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.",Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources River Development and
311,2144,positive,"Thousands of farmers from across the country will assemble at Ramlila Maidan here on Thursday, and then march towards Parliament the next day. They are petitioning the President to call for a special session of Parliament to discuss the agrarian crisis and pass two Bills on farmers debts and guaranteed minimum support prices for their crops.
A culmination
Ã¢ÂÂOver the last one and a half years, farmers have been protesting across the country. This is a culmination, an eye-opener moment for farmers that the government has still not heard their distress,Ã¢ÂÂ said V.M. Singh, convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, the banner organisation of 200 farmer groups which has issued the call for this Kisan Mukti March. Ã¢ÂÂThe elections are around the corner. There is no more time, no more jumlas [empty promises] will be accepted. Farmers are demanding that this government keeps its promises and passes these Bills before its term ends,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.
The two proposed legislations are the FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Freedom from Indebtedness Bill, 2018, and The FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ Right to Guaranteed Remunerative Minimum Support Prices for Agricultural Commodities Bill, 2018, which were introduced as private member Bills in the last session of Parliament. At the time, 21 political parties had indicated their support.
With Subhash Chandra BoseÃ¢ÂÂs slogan of Ã¢ÂÂDilli ChaloÃ¢ÂÂ on their lips, about 10,000 farmers and supporters are expected to march from five different directions in the city towards the vast grounds of Ramlila Maidan where they will camp on Thursday night.
While the Delhi Police have given their permission for ThursdayÃ¢ÂÂs marches, there is still doubt regarding FridayÃ¢ÂÂs mega rally, when organisers expect one lakh people to march from Ramlila to Jantar Mantar, the protest venue on Parliament Street. Police guidelines states, Ã¢ÂÂThe total number of protesters at Jantar Mantar shall not exceed 1,000Ã¢ÂÂ. The guidelines also stipulate that no march to or from the Jantar Mantar venue will be allowed.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are still having talks with the police, and there is a final meeting planned for tomorrow. But we have decided to march. Four years of the Modi government has seen a total betrayal of farmers. They cannot be stopped now,Ã¢ÂÂ said Vijoo Krishnan, Joint Secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, a CPI-M affiliated farmersÃ¢ÂÂ group that is a key part of the march organisation.
Apart from farmers and agricultural labourers, organisers hope to draw in several thousand students, artists and middle-class urban professionals under the banner of a fledgling forum called Ã¢ÂÂNation for FarmersÃ¢ÂÂ.
P. Sainath, veteran rural journalist and the key force behind the forum, says he was inspired by the doctors, lawyers and businessmen who stepped out to engage with adivasi farmers who marched from Nashik to Mumbai in March. Ã¢ÂÂAfter economic liberalisation in 1991, the links between farmers and urban Indian consumers were broken. We are now rebuilding that engagement. This is not a culmination; itÃ¢ÂÂs a historic beginning,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.",Dilli Chalo: farmers pour into Capital to prepare for Parliament march
312,2147,positive,"By Ramesh Bhushal Undervalued and ignored, wetlands are disappearing and drying up in Nepal Ã¢ÂÂ leaving the communities and wildlife that depend on them exposed in a changing climate A few kilometres north of the Indian border in the Kapilvastu district Ã¢ÂÂ the birth place of the Buddha Ã¢ÂÂ lies Jagdishpur lake, the largest reservoir in Nepal, and one of the ten wetlands in the country listed under the Ramsar Convention. The lake is home to about 23,000 birds according to the latest survey Ã¢ÂÂ probably the largest single avian population in the country. Local farmer Purnabashi Chaudhary often visits the lake to collect medicinal plants. When we reached the lake one early afternoon in the first week of February, Chaudhary was resting in the shade of a tree after applying the juice of the Madaar plant to his teeth. Ã¢ÂÂIt relieves pain,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, pointing to a shrub nearby. Ã¢ÂÂBut the overgrazing of goats has left very few plants around the lake now.Ã¢ÂÂ

The lake was declared a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention in 2003, but since then there has been little action to protect the lake. Ã¢ÂÂThere is very minimal funding available to protect or conserve this lake, itÃ¢ÂÂs mostly our voluntary efforts that are keeping it alive,Ã¢ÂÂ said Abdul Rashid Khan, a local conservationist who lives near the lake. In the early 70s, the reservoir was built to irrigate adjoining paddy fields and later expanded to 225 hectares. This became one of the best habitats for endemic and migratory birds. However, locals were not aware of its importance until recently. Ã¢ÂÂPeople used to think that these birds come every year, so whatÃ¢ÂÂs wrong with killing them for meat?Ã¢ÂÂ added Khan. This all changed when the local communities came together to control such activities a few years ago. But the poaching hasnÃ¢ÂÂt stopped completely. Ã¢ÂÂSome people still kill birds. If asked not to, then they threaten us and say [the birds] are public property,Ã¢ÂÂ Chaudhary said. Weighty wetlands According to the Ramsar Convention, 2,293 lakes are listed as wetlands of international importance globally, covering 230 million hectares. Listed as the richest ecosystems on earth after tropical rainforests, these wetlands support wild animals and plants, some of which are on the brink of extinction. Jagdishpur hosts not only water fowl but the one horned rhinos and royal Bengal tigers also use these wetlands as a source of water.

Wetlands are also a major source of livelihood for communities across Nepal. From fish to fodder, drinking water to medicinal plants, communities benefit from the natural wealth of wetlands. Ã¢ÂÂWe can hardly think of life without this water source, as it irrigates our fields, provides water to drink,Ã¢ÂÂ said Krishna Chaudhary, drinking untreated water from the source of Ghodaghodi lake in Kailali district. Ã¢ÂÂWe are at the source so I can drink water without treatment, but as you move south, it gets polluted and you canÃ¢ÂÂt imagine drinking it,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, smiling. Undervalued and ignored Government officials agree that enough has not been done to protect wetlands and it is a low priority issue on their agenda. Ã¢ÂÂWith increasing population pressure, land degradation, haphazard road construction and unplanned urbanisation, there is tremendous pressure on wetlands and we should be more serious about protecting these water bodies which are often termed as the earthÃ¢ÂÂs kidneys,Ã¢ÂÂ said Maheshwar Dhakal, joint secretary at the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Nepal government. Ã¢ÂÂWith the federal system in place now, we hope that the wetlands will receive more attention in future,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Nepal promulgated a new constitution in 2015 and decided to establish a federal system, abolishing the monarchy. Under the new constitution, federal governments are now responsible for managing wetlands. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not about who has been given authority, itÃ¢ÂÂs about where this falls on their priority list. Wetlands have been thought of as wastelands in spite of their significant role in ecosystems, and they continue to be encroached or destroyed,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hem Sagar Baral, Country Manager at the Zoological Society of LondonÃ¢ÂÂs Nepal office and a noted ornithologist in the country.

A heaven for birds Ã¢ÂÂ but for how long? Ã¢ÂÂMy first visit to Nepal was in 1978. I will forever remember the remarkable diversity of bird life that greeted us in the Sal forests of the Terai Ã¢ÂÂ the feeding parties, seemingly in a hurry, packed full of woodpeckers, drongos, flycatchers, and warblers. Bird after bird was new for me and I was in heaven,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote Richard Grimmett, who now heads the Bird Life InternationalÃ¢ÂÂs global conservation program, in a book titled, Status of NepalÃ¢ÂÂs birds: The National Rest List series. But in last 40 years, things have changed considerably. Ã¢ÂÂAbout 20 percent of NepalÃ¢ÂÂs 878 birds are threatened with extinction, including 37 species which are threatened on a global scale, according to the latest research by Bird Life International and the Zoological Society of London. About 25 percent of those threatened are wetland birds.

This yearÃ¢ÂÂs survey of birds, which is yet to be published, estimates 45,000 to 50,000 birds travelled from northern Asia to Nepal this winter Ã¢ÂÂ travelling from as far away as Siberia. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to count exact numbers but our regular survey shows about 150 species of birds migrate to Nepal in winter every year and about one-third of them are wetland-dependent,Ã¢ÂÂ said Baral, country manager of Nepal at the Zoological Society of London. But ornithologists have warned that the rapid degradation and deterioration of wetlands may lead to permanent extinction of several species. Comb Ducks used to be spotted frequently on Ghodaghodi, the largest lake in Kailali district, NepalÃ¢ÂÂs far western region. But the species hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been recorded in the area for the past 20 years, said Baral. Ã¢ÂÂUnlike other species, the Comb Duck wonÃ¢ÂÂt easily bounce back even if conditions are made favourable,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. The Comb Duck is listed under category II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), meaning it will soon be threatened with extinction if it is not protected. There isnÃ¢ÂÂt much research being done on the impact of urbanisation, habitat destruction and other developmental works on the wetlands. Since the birds fly across countries it is hard to estimate the full impact without coordinated transboundary research, Baral said, Ã¢ÂÂBut research in Nepal suggests overall population is declining with some species already rare and threatened,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Another ornithologist Benj Smelt, who has been doing research on birds in Ghodaghodi, said that once common species like peafowl (Mayur) have almost disappeared, and called for authorities to take action before it is too late. Human -wildlife conflict Jogilal Dagaura has a contract to raise fish in a small pond on the boundary of Ghodaghodi lake owned by Ghodaghodi Forest UsersÃ¢ÂÂ Group. While his sons sell fish in the market, his job is to guard the lake and protect the fish from birds. Every few minutes, he makes a loud sound to distract birds that come to feed in the pond. As we tried to talk to him, he ran to another corner of the lake as he saw some birds trying to catch fish. ItÃ¢ÂÂs his daily routine. Ã¢ÂÂWe bring fingerlings and grow them in this pond and sell them in the market, but itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to save them from birds,Ã¢ÂÂ said Dagaura. Birds have become a source of conflict in villages because they eat the crops. In Ghodaghodi, lake conservation is a story of happiness and sorrow. On the one hand, communities are happy to help protect the lake and birds, but on the other hand, birds have left them helpless. Ã¢ÂÂThey eat our crops, which is the only source of food for many of us, as we canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to buy food. ItÃ¢ÂÂs really hard to farm here with birds around,Ã¢ÂÂ said Deepak Shah, Chairperson of Ghodaghodi Community Forest UserÃ¢ÂÂs Group. People have been demanding compensation for years, but the government has turned a deaf ear. Ã¢ÂÂWho listens to us? A compensation policy would have been very helpful as it would encourage local communities to engage with conservation of lakes and birds, but authorities are not bothered about it,Ã¢ÂÂ added Shah.

The Nepal government has a policy to compensate people for the damage caused by wild animals but this doesnÃ¢ÂÂt include birds. Deepak Shah thinks that the government is not serious about protecting lakes or forests and the communityÃ¢ÂÂs efforts have been undervalued. A few years ago, he said, a boy fell into Ghodaghodi lake while playing and was killed by a crocodile. Villagers dragged his body out of the crocodileÃ¢ÂÂs mouth and demanded compensation from the government for his family, but not a single penny was provided.

Image by Nabin Baral

Ã¢ÂÂInstead, authorities took that wounded crocodile, arranged for a veterinary doctor from Kathmandu and put it back in a river nearby after treatment. They didnÃ¢ÂÂt even provide transportation to carry the boyÃ¢ÂÂs dead body to the place of cremation,Ã¢ÂÂ Shah added. The district administration office said that there is no policy to compensate for such casualties. Ã¢ÂÂDespite our commitment and efforts to save the lake, the authorities have not valued our contribution and that has irked the communities. Humans have less value than animals here,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. Declining fish diversity, worried fishermen About 21 ethnic communities directly depend on the wetlands of Nepal, and fishing is one of their major occupations. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to get fish nowadays, wetlands are shrinking or disappearing and there are too many people,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bimala Bote, a fisherwoman near the Jagdishpur lake in Kapilvastu in west Nepal. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not only in Jagdishpur that the fish are declining. Rupa Chaudhary in the Maghi village near Ghodaghodi lake in the far west had a similar experience. Research shows that fish diversity is declining rapidly in the wetlands of Nepal, especially in the southern plains. In Ghodaghodi lake alone there has been a 50 percent decline in fish diversity over the last 20 years. Twenty-seven fish species were recorded in 1998, but only 13 species were found in 2017. Fishing communities in the east are equally worried. On the Koshi riverbank we met Chandan Kumar Mukhiya, a fisherman who feeds his family of four. As fishing became more difficult, he opted to take a part time job as an electrician in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs capital New Delhi. Ã¢ÂÂFish are declining and some days I have to return home empty handed. A few years ago, this wasnÃ¢ÂÂt the case,Ã¢ÂÂ Mukhiya said.

A 2009 study found fish from the wetlands of Koshi Tappu are the most important source of food and income for local people. There are 15 ethnic communities who depend on fishing in the Koshi Tappu wetland alone. Ã¢ÂÂIn the past there were few people who used to fish, but nowadays, everyone is fishing. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to find fish,Ã¢ÂÂ added Mukhiya. Wetlands are also the major source of drinking water for wildlife, including rare or endangered species. Wildlife officials said an increasingly dry climate across the country has put wetlands under threat Ã¢ÂÂ and this will lead to a shortage of water for animals to drink. Ã¢ÂÂWe have already started pumping groundwater and collecting it in the ponds for wildlife to drink in western Nepal, but increasing dryness may lead to similar conditions in central and eastern Nepal,Ã¢ÂÂ said Bed Kumar Dhakal, chief warden at Chitwan National Park. Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt have long-term data to help us understand the pattern of change in our wetlands. I think is very important to invest in this so we can make better plans before itÃ¢ÂÂs too late,Ã¢ÂÂ he added. According to NepalÃ¢ÂÂs Water and Energy Commission Secretariat report, the annual average precipitation over Nepal is decreasing at the rate of 9.8 mm per decade.

A need for better management and more respect Wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet but the richest in biodiversity. Ã¢ÂÂThe first thing is to make everyone understand that these are not wastelands and they have a huge role in providing food, water, medicine and many other services as well as maintain ecosystems,Ã¢ÂÂ said Hem Sagar Baral. As the most undervalued natural resources in the country they fall prey to any development work, but they need more respect. Ã¢ÂÂOur thinking in Nepal needs to change,Ã¢ÂÂ said Maheshwar Dhakal, joint secretary at the ministry of environment and forests. Ã¢ÂÂFor us water means rivers flowing from north to south and we hardly consider the small ponds, lakes or marshy lands that provide such an important resource to people. They deserve better respect and better management.Ã¢ÂÂ

The new subspecies of bandy-bandy, a family of burrowing snakes endemic to Australia, was found by chance by biologists from the University of Queensland, who have quickly applied for it to be given protected status.

The team came across it while researching sea snakes near Weipa, a mining town on the west coast of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs Cape York Peninsula, in May.

Ã¢ÂÂBandy-bandy is a burrowing snake, so Freek Vonk from the Naturalis Museum and I were surprised to find it on a concrete block by the sea,Ã¢ÂÂ said Professor Bryan Fry, who was leading the research.

Ã¢ÂÂWe later discovered that the snake had slithered over from a pile of bauxite rubble waiting to be loaded onto a ship.

Ã¢ÂÂOn examination by my student, Chantelle Derez, the bandy-bandy turned out to be a new species, visually and genetically distinct from those found on the Australian East coast and parts of the interior.Ã¢ÂÂ

The team found another specimen in its natural habitat near Weipa and another that had been killed by a car close to a mine. Two more were discovered in museum collections.

Biologists were previously aware of five species of bandy-bandy, also known as the hoop snake, which carry a mild venom, can grow to about a metre in length, and feed almost exclusively on blind snakes.

DNA analysis confirmed the discovery of a new species, which has been formally named Vermicella parscauda.

The Queensland biologistsÃ¢ÂÂ study, published in the journal Zootaxa, also established that the species was more closely related to bandy-bandies which live in Western AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs tropical forests than those found in the Cape York Peninsula.

The biologists this week formally applied for the Queensland governmentÃ¢ÂÂs Department of Environment and Science to declare the snake a threatened species.
