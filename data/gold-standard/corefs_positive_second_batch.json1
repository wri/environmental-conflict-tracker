Would the government want to go ahead and impose this levy in a pre-election year? In addition, there are sensitivities of farmers also involved,” Abhay Laijawala, Head – India Research, Deutsche Equities said in an interview to CNBC TV18. The expert pointed out that there has been a lot of distress in the agriculture space, leaving little room for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to bring agriculture income under the tax net in the upcoming Union Budget 2018. “Clearly over the last three years we have seen acute rural distress and if the government goes ahead and instead of resolving acute rural distress is seen imposing a tax on agriculture, politically there would be a very low political threshold for the same,” Abhay Laijawala told the channel.

This report primarily targets stakeholders in the farming sector which include contract farming / value chain promoters, farmer’s producer organizations and farmers as well as other citizens of the country for farmer’s producer organizations and farmers as well as other citizens of the country views and comments on the same. To understand what it entails we must first understand the concept of Contract Farming. In recent times agriculture has undergone tremendous shift in terms of how the occupation in the occupation in itself is viewed and the social relations that the occupation in itself entails. With introduction of challenges such as pressure on land, climate change and the response advent of new technologies, agriculture undoubtedly is in the cusp of a new beginning. This is the background in which the concept of contract farming can be best explained. In contract farming, a company or an organisation enters into an agreement with a farmer. In an agreement with a farmer a farmer is given pre-decided support for agriculture while a farmer assures crops at a pre-decided price and quality. In this process, the farmers are given every possible help by way of seeds, fertilisers etc by the company so that a farmer can produce the desired results. The rationale behind the emergence of such a system was predominantly to cash in on the increasing opportunities provided in the agricultural sector while protecting a farmer from price shocks at the same time. In fact, as repeated incidents have proved, the volatility of prices hit the farmers much more that the farmers hit the consumers. Companies are also saved from price volatility due to assurance of availability of raw materials.", "meta": {"class": "positive", "id": 5503.0, "month": 1.0}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[25, 35, "actor"], [49, 94, "action"], [256, 262, "actor"], [292, 298, "actor"], [345, 351, "actor"], [381, 387, "actor"], [1088, 1094, "actor"], [1119, 1125, "actor"], [1128, 1134, "actor"], [1188, 1194, "actor"], [1266, 1272, "actor"], [1362, 1368, "actor"], [1570, 1576, "actor"], [1717, 1723, "actor"], [1690, 1696, "actor"]]}

Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy noted that an agreement was signed by the two governments in 1961 to share water from Veedur dam to meet the irrigation requirements of farmers in Mannadipet constituency in the union territory. The deal ensured availability of water for Puducherry for 175 days to enable farmers here to get water for cultivation on an extent of 1400 hectares from Veedur dam, Puducherry said. \"The release of water for Mannadipet block was stopped this year.. Our plea is that the agreement should be enforced by the Tamil Nadu authorities,\" Puducherry said adding a letter would be shot off to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu seeking immediate release of water in keeping with the provisions of the agreement. Veedur dam is situated in the catchment areas of Varaha river and Thondiaru in Villupuram district and had been a source of irrigation for farm lands in Mannadipet constituency in Puducherry. \"Besides, Tamil Nadu government was ignoring the Union Territorys share of 6 tmc feet of water released into the Cauvery basin by Tamil Nadu government,\" Narayanasamy alleged.

{"id": 1188, "text": "The Western Ghats is one of 14 biodiversity hotspots in the world, stretching from the Tapti River to Kanyakumari through Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 63 rivers originate from different locations of the stretch and the lives of the people of the entire Indian peninsula are dependent on the people of the entire Indian peninsula. The area comprises of gentle to steep slopes and supports a huge biodiversity of flora and fauna. Population growth has resulted in expansion of human areas and consequently diversion of forest lands for development projects such as roads, railway lines, transmission lines, reservoirs for irrigation and power projects, etc. Forests are also denuded and degraded due to heavy anthropogenic pressure of encroachments, grazing, forest fires, illicit cutting of trees for timber, poles and firewood, and illegal collection of non-timber forest products (NTFP) and medicinal plants. The Forest Rights Act 2006, to safeguard the rights of scheduled tribes and other forest dwellers, was enacted with good intent, but the implementation was tardy as officers came under pressure to accept all claims. In forested districts like North Kanara, Haveri, Kodagu and Shimoga, there was aggressive clearing of forest growth. The communities had the patronage of political masters. Politicians conducted public meetings and encouraged villagers to clear more and more forests and claim title. When the cases were rejected by Deputy Commissioners, the cases were pressured. Forest officers were silent spectators as tree-growth clearing continued unabated. Areas, where encroachments were evicted, were reoccupied and titles were claimed. It may be time to take a relook at the Forest Rights Act. The Karnataka (Preservation) of Trees Act was meant to regulate permissions for tree-felling on private lands in the Western Ghats. Not all wooded areas were reserved. Vast stretches, especially in Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Kodagu districts, were under the control of the Revenue Department. Kodagu district had a number of confusing land tenures; officers, politicians and timber merchants have enjoyed this confusion. Some areas were encroached and much more were allotted for coffee cultivation. Wooded areas lost Wooded areas character as varieties of timber species were extracted by merchants. Coffee plantations have now a monoculture of silver oak trees. A series of reports by the French Institute of Pondicherry suggest that Kodagu district lost 30% of tree cover between 1967 and 2007.

Subbaiah and her husband had shifted back to Kodagu five years ago, after her husband had retired from her husband job at Bengaluru. her added, \"Everyone thinks the reason for all this damage and loss of life is the buildings that have come up everywhere and the constant use of earthmovers and drillers. A fragile region like ours just cannot take that much pressure.\" The district of Kodagu is indeed used to heavy rains, especially when the Southwest monsoons traverses The district of Kodagu during The district of Kodagu journey across the Indian subcontinent. Thus, when heavy rains battered the region in June this year and continued over the next few months, there was an apprehension about loss of good coffee crop (Karnataka grows more than 50 percent of India's coffee) but no one was thinking of extensive damage, lesser still about entire villages being consumed by landslides. It was the mid-August rains that began on Independence Day, August 15, and continued unabated till August 17, that broke the levee, quite literally. Over the course of three days, August 15, 16 and 17, Kodagu received 768 mm of rainfall. This is almost half of the entire rainfall received in August, which was 1,675 mm. The rainfall recorded in August 2018 broke all records in living memory -- it was back in 1931 that Kodagu had last received such heavy rainfall. Even then, August 1931 had recorded 1,559 mm of rainfall. The fact that this time most of the rain fell over a period of 72 hours made things worse.", "meta": {"class": "positive", "id": 2008.0, "month": 9.0}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[51, 59, "actor"], [86, 102, "actor"], [266, 283, "action"], [612, 652, "action"], [803, 811, "actor"], [938, 957, "action"], [926, 937, "actor"], [1048, 1072, "action"], [1512, 1520, "actor"], [1565, 1574, "actor"], [1697, 1705, "actor"], [534, 557, "action"]]}

In Gurugram August 31 order, the court of additional district judge (Gurugram) Jasbir Singh Kundu also said that MCG had to give compensation to the original proprietors (Jumla Mulkaan), mentioned in the revenue records of November 5, 1980 to retain ownership of the land. This ensures compensation for original proprietors and not third parties who purchased the land subsequently and filed civil suits over the land.The land, worth Rs 3,000 crore, has been the subject of a tussle between the government and private entities since the mid-1950s when a mutation was carried out, transferring ownership to the gram panchayat. In 2008, when MCG was formed, MCG municipal limits subsumed Gwalpahari. Earlier, a total of 322 private entities had filed 118 suits, challenging MCG’s claim of ownership over the land. On April 16 this year, the court of civil judge (senior division) Prashant Rana held that the ownership would rest with private owners. MCG had filed an appeal against the order in the session court.Passing MCG judgment, the session court observed that out of the 118 plaintiffs, seven — Fateh Singh, Nathey, Atinder, Karam Singh, Raju, Durga and Shyam Lal — were original proprietors while the remaining 111 were neither Biswedars (proprietors) nor Gair Biswedars (non-proprietor natives) but were claiming a share of the Shamlat Deh (common land) through neither Biswedars (proprietors) nor Gair Biswedars (non-proprietor natives) civil suits.

What comes to mind are the distraught men and women in anonymous Indian villages. award-winning conservationist Prerna Singh Bindra thinks of Sumitra bai and Bhuvan Dhanwar, trampled beyond recognition in Chhattisgarh. award-winning conservationist Prerna Singh Bindra thinks of elephant tracker Panchanan Nayak stoically following Odisha’s Athgarh herd and warning villagers of their path, all the while risking his life. award-winning conservationist Prerna Singh Bindra thinks of a crowd of locals in West Bengal placing flowers on the body of an elephant hit by a speeding train. Graceful even in death, an elephant hit by a speeding train fell into a deep, open well one night in Palakkad, Kerala. an elephant hit by a speeding train suspects an elephant hit by a speeding train emerged from the nearby forest to feast on fruiting jackfruit trees in the village. Open wells are a serious but little-recognised threat to wild animals, including Gujarat’s famed Asiatic lions, a few of which fall to their deaths every year.

{"id": 1212, "text": "The killing of Avni has outraged people across the nation because, in a sense, The killing of Avni represents the same senseless violence that appears to have gripped us in recent years. And the politics behind The killing of Avni appears to have the same sense of déjà vu. How people in power use a conflict situation as an opportunity to grab land (hundreds of hectares of precious forest land in this case) and sell (hundreds of hectares of precious forest land in this case) at a throwaway price to their business cronies. And, once again, the same names reappear as beneficiaries. But let’s start at the beginning. Who was Avni? Avni was a six-year-old tigress, the mother of two ten-month-old cubs. Avni was officially known as T1. Avni’s home was Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district. Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district is a small forest being rapidly encroached upon by the locals as well as those who come in search of lime, coal and dolomite. For a mere Rs 40 crore, almost 500 hectares of the forest was given away (you could say almost gifted) by the government to Anil Ambani, currently much in the news for the Dassault offsets. Anil Ambani was to set up a cement plant there. a cement plant, of course, got promptly sold off-lock, stock and barrel to another business house for Rs 4,800 crore, thus benchmarking the land’s actual value. While Avni and Avni mate were planning a family, which would have in turn grown the tiger population in the forest, several industrial groups were also eyeing the land. There was another cement plant coming up there as well as a power plant. Others were also lining up, eager to grab a part of the forest and, as we all know, there were ministers in the Congress (and in the current BJP) always ready to sign away forest land. It is a big business today. But Avni didn’t know that. Avni saw it as Avni home.", "meta": {"class": "positive", "id": 1179.0, "month": 11.0}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[33, 39, "actor"], [51, 57, "actor"], [4, 11, "action"], [119, 137, "action"], [340, 349, "action"], [384, 395, "actor"], [509, 525, "actor"], [658, 665, "actor"], [699, 703, "actor"], [836, 842, "actor"], [857, 867, "action"], [1002, 1023, "action"], [1061, 1071, "actor"], [1160, 1181, "action"], [1424, 1450, "action"], [1458, 1464, "actor"], [1474, 1491, "actor"], [1513, 1517, "actor"], [1537, 1549, "actor"], [1579, 1590, "actor"], [1629, 1654, "action"], [1687, 1696, "actor"], [1789, 1797, "action"]]}

We have been representing to the central government and GST Council for a long time, but in vain. We will wait till the upcoming Union Budget is presented and then launch a nation-wide protest without shutting down We units. All our demands are genuine and the natural law of justice should prevail in power loom sector.”He said there is production loss of fabrics by more than 20 per cent in power loom sector in Mumbai and Surat, while overall production loss in the country was at 10 per cent. This has led to thousands of textile workers losing their jobs.The representatives of power loom associations were disappointed over the customs notification issued on October 27, 2017, which has placed restriction on any increase from the current import duty of 10 per cent on imported silk fabrics and MMF fabrics. The representatives of power loom associations requested the government to increase import duty from 10 per cent to 25 per cent and 0 per cent to 25 per cent on fabrics imported from China and Vietnam.Additional commissioner of GST and central excise Prashant Kaduskar, who was also present in the AGM, told TOI, “The demands put forth by the representatives at FIASWI’s AGM are genuine. The demands put forth by the representatives at FIASWI’s AGM will be forwarded to the concerned ministry in New Delhi.”", "meta": {"class": "positive", "id": 1511.0, "month": 1.0}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[42, 49, "actor"], [64, 84, "actor"], [127, 162, "action"], [216, 234, "actor"], [482, 523, "action"], [617, 666, "action"], [732, 781, "action"], [877, 915, "action"], [1057, 1109, "action"], [1519, 1538, "action"], [1684, 1710, "action"], [1872, 1905, "action"], [1859, 1868, "number"], [2221, 2231, "actor"], [2235, 2255, "action"], [2372, 2384, "actor"], [2478, 2495, "action"], [2552, 2569, "action"], [2617, 2652, "action"]]}

Foundation laying ceremony of the cow reserve was held in December 2012 which was attended by RSS chief Dr Mohan Bhagwat.Intended to provide shelter to aged and deserted cows, this facility was started only in September last year.Over the past four months, huge number of cows has allegedly died unnatural deaths. Congress claims that not less than 300 cows have died in the past one month and the “mystery of unnatural deaths” is in the fodder, supply contract of which is with a local BJP man.“Deaths of a massive number of cows soon after the inception of cow reserve is a serious issue,” Madhya Pradesh assembly Ajay Singh wrote to the RSS chief. “You must be informed that in the past one month more than 300 cow deaths have been reported. Prior to this incident, another “goshala” in Lalatipara of Gwalior also had 1500 cow deaths. It is sad that such incidents are happening in a state where the government swears by cows. You and the BJP think cows are part of the country’s culture and tradition but unfortunately in the same party’s regime cows are dying brutal deaths,” the letter claimed.Madhya Pradesh assembly Ajay Singh reminded Dr Bhagwat that during the foundation laying ceremony of the cow reserve, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised to make the place a pilgrimage spot of cows. “But the cow reserve turned-out to be a death-bed for the bovine species,” Ajay Singh’s letter said.

We saw not more than 2,500 cattle. State government wants to hush-up the matter while contamination in the fodder is suspected to be the cause of cattle deaths,” the letter said.state Congress president Arun Yadav argued that the entire nation has witnessed how cow vigilantes in the name of bovine protection and based on mere suspicion have killed people. “And in this state, the crime is occurring in the rule of those who call themselves cow-bhakts (devotees). Today when cows are getting killed under government protection, why is your government and vigilantes silent?” Ajay Singh asked.Ajay Singh wrote that if Dr Mohan Bhagwat really believed that cows are part of India’s culture and tradition like Dr Mohan Bhagwat said during the foundation laying ceremony of the cow reserve in Salariya, then Dr Mohan Bhagwat should visit the place himself.
